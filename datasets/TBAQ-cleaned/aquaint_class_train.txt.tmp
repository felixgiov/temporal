The _

Unless _

The _

made _
the _
fairly _

Doris _

made OCCURRENCE
it _
clear _
that _

followed OCCURRENCE

Moreover _
, _
by _
setting OCCURRENCE

the _
immigration _

allowed OCCURRENCE
Elian _

American _
relatives _
time _
to _
test OCCURRENCE
the _
ruling OCCURRENCE
in _
court _
. _
Elian _
was _
one _
of _
13 _
Cubans _
who _
were _
trying I_ACTION
to _
cross OCCURRENCE
from _

Florida _
six _
weeks _

on _
a _

Ten _
of _
those _
on _

died OCCURRENCE
, _
including _
his _
mother _
and _
stepfather _

The _
boy _
clung OCCURRENCE
to _
an _
inner _
tube _
for _
two _
days DURATION
and _
was _
plucked OCCURRENCE
from _
the _
Atlantic _
on _
Thanksgiving _

brought OCCURRENCE
ashore _

He _
was _
immediately _
released OCCURRENCE
into _
the _
custody _
of _
relatives _
in _
Miami _
_ _
and _
just _
as _
quickly _
embraced OCCURRENCE
as _
a _

poisonous _
estrangement _

Fidel _

its _
opponents _
in _

This _

argued OCCURRENCE

the _
start OCCURRENCE
that _
Elian _
not _
be _
denied OCCURRENCE
due _
process _
because _
of _
his _
youth _
, _
and _
the _
INS _
appears OCCURRENCE
to _
have _
moved OCCURRENCE
carefully _
. _
Elian _
's _
great _

uncle _
and _
other _
American _
relatives _
were _
allowed OCCURRENCE
to _
make OCCURRENCE
their _

that _

should _
have _

The _
boy _

divorced OCCURRENCE
father _

Juan _
Miguel _
Gonzalez _

a _
close _

The _
mother _
's _
parents _
also _
argued OCCURRENCE

a _
return OCCURRENCE

The _
INS _
decided OCCURRENCE
that _
under _
their _
prevailing _
policies _
, _
Gonzalez _
met OCCURRENCE
the _
test _
that _
calls _
for _
custody _
reverting OCCURRENCE

the _
sole _

treating OCCURRENCE

ATLANTA _
_ _
Good _
for _
Attorney _
General _
Janet _
Reno _
for _
the _
sensible _
opinion _
she _
rendered OCCURRENCE
in _
the _
case _
of _
Elian _
Gonzalez _
. _
Some _
semblance _
of _
constitutional _
order _
was _
necessary _
after _
a _
Miami _
judge _
turned OCCURRENCE
legal _
logic _
on _
its _
head _
in _
an _
effort _
to _
route OCCURRENCE

court _

Immigration _
, _
after _
all _

is _
strictly _
a _
federal _
matter _

If _
the _
Immigration _
and _
Naturalization _
Service _
order OCCURRENCE
that _
Elian _
must _
be _
returned OCCURRENCE
to _
his _
father _
in _
Cuba _
is _
to _
be _
contested OCCURRENCE
, _
Reno _
ruled OCCURRENCE
correctly _
that _
the _
only _
proper _
venue _
is _
federal _
court _
, _
not _
state _
or _
local _
. _
If _
and _
when _
the _
relatives _
' _
appeal OCCURRENCE
goes OCCURRENCE
to _
federal _
court _
, _
chances _
of _
a _
favorable _
ruling OCCURRENCE
are _
slim _
. _
First _
of _
all _
, _
the _
INS _
already _
has _
taken OCCURRENCE
the _
position _
the _
only _
person _
who _
can _
petition OCCURRENCE
for _
U.S. _
asylum _
for _
Elian _
is _
his _
father _
, _
which _
he _
is _
not _
about _
to _
do OCCURRENCE
. _
Moreover _
, _
immigration _
law _
provides OCCURRENCE
that _
asylum _
can _
only _
be _
granted OCCURRENCE
where _
there _
is _
an _
imminent _
threat _
of _
torture OCCURRENCE
or _
persecution OCCURRENCE
in _
the _
petitioner _
's _
homeland _
, _
which _
nobody _
expects I_STATE
in _
Elian _
's _
case _
. _
It _
's _
not _
enough _
to _
argue OCCURRENCE
Elian _
may _
suffer OCCURRENCE
privation OCCURRENCE
or _
oppression OCCURRENCE
in _
Fidel _
Castro _
's _
failed OCCURRENCE
Communist _
state _
. _
The _
INS _
routinely _
sends OCCURRENCE
prospective _
immigrants _
back _
to _
countries _
where _
poverty _
and _
tyranny _
are _
worse _
than _
in _
Cuba _
. _
What _
matters _
most _
is _
that _
Elian _
, _
after _
losing OCCURRENCE
his _
mother _
and _
stepfather _
in _
a _
disastrous _
sea _
voyage OCCURRENCE
to _
the _
United _

last _
November DATE

needs I_STATE

his _
life _

his _
father _

both _
sets _

True _
, _
they _
ca _
n't _
give OCCURRENCE
him _
all _
the _
material _
things _
his _
Miami _
benefactors _
can _
, _
but _
there _
are _
intangibles _
in _
close _
family _
bonds _
that _
are _
more _
valuable _
than _
bicycles _
and _
trips OCCURRENCE

Disney _
World _

The _
next _
order _
of _
business _
for _
the _
Justice _

separated OCCURRENCE

unsubstantiated _

The _

judgment _

clearly _
been _
clouded OCCURRENCE

animosity _

Once _

_ _
it _
would _
be _
preferable _
if _
he _
went OCCURRENCE
to _

rather _
than _

Washington _
_ _
only _
the _
most _
obdurate _
foes _

can _
argue OCCURRENCE
that _
Elian _
should _
not _
be _
reunited OCCURRENCE
with _
him _
. _
Gonzalez _
's _
arrival OCCURRENCE
should _
also _
help I_ACTION
clear OCCURRENCE
the _
way _
for _
the _
Justice _
Department _
to _
make OCCURRENCE
arrangements I_ACTION
to _
transfer OCCURRENCE
custody _

the _
child _

The _
Miami _
relatives _
have _
left OCCURRENCE
unclear _
whether _
they _
will _
willingly _
relinquish OCCURRENCE
custody _
of _
Elian _
, _
and _
have _
done _
their _
best _
to _
stir OCCURRENCE
passions _
against _
the _
Justice _
Department _
among _
Cuban _
- _
Americans _
in _
South _
Florida _
. _
In _
hopes _
of _
trumping OCCURRENCE
the _
law _
, _
they _
have _
unreasonably _
demanded OCCURRENCE
that _
a _
panel _
of _
child _
psychologists _
determine OCCURRENCE
Elian _
's _
fate _
. _
The _
best _
outcome OCCURRENCE
would _
be _
for _
the _
relatives _
to _
turn OCCURRENCE
Elian _
over _
to _
his _
father _
as _
soon _
as _
Gonzalez _
arrives OCCURRENCE
, _
and _
to _
do OCCURRENCE
so _
in _
a _
spirit _
of _
kinship _
that _
makes OCCURRENCE
the _
transition OCCURRENCE
as _
smooth _
as _
possible _
for _
Elian _
. _
Once _
that _
happens OCCURRENCE
, _
Gonzalez _
and _
Elian _
, _
though _
technically _
free _
to _
return OCCURRENCE
to _
Cuba _
, _
should _
remain _
here _
to _
await OCCURRENCE
an _
appellate _
court _
ruling OCCURRENCE

expected I_STATE

But _
if _
the _

balk OCCURRENCE

the _
Justice _
Department _
should _
quickly _
revoke OCCURRENCE
their _
custody _
of _
the _
child _
and _
obtain I_STATE
a _
federal _
court _
order OCCURRENCE
instructing OCCURRENCE
them _
and _
their _
lawyers _
to _
turn OCCURRENCE
Elian _
over _
to _
his _
father _
. _
The _
relatives _
may _
be _
less _
defiant _
if _
they _
are _
held OCCURRENCE
in _
contempt _
of _
court _
. _
If _
a _
court _
edict OCCURRENCE
fails OCCURRENCE
to _
compel ASPECTUAL
compliance OCCURRENCE
, _
the _
Justice _
Department _
will _
have _
to _
consider I_STATE
sterner _
measures _

for _
the _

be _
resisting I_ACTION
the _
rule _
of _

as _
defined OCCURRENCE

both _
the _
department _

the _
courts _

But _
Washington _
ought _
not _
to _
rush OCCURRENCE
to _
take OCCURRENCE
Elian _
forcibly _
from _
the _
relatives _
. _
That _
course _
would _
be _
psychologically _
wounding _
to _

and _
could _
lead OCCURRENCE

a _
violent _
confrontation OCCURRENCE

The _

yields I_STATE
none _

legal _

moral _
authority _
in _

The _

confirmed REPORTING

decision _

neutral _
setting _

he _
is _

both _

treating OCCURRENCE
the _
raid OCCURRENCE
to _
return OCCURRENCE
Elian _
as _
though _
it _
were _
a _
Nazi _
SS _
operation OCCURRENCE
. _
Yet _
federal _
agents _
had _
a _
warrant _
, _
were _
enforcing OCCURRENCE
US _

entered OCCURRENCE
the _
house _
with _
the _
proper _
force _

ensure OCCURRENCE
minimal _
resistance I_ACTION

injury OCCURRENCE

It _
was _
a _
model _
of _
efficient _
law _
enforcement _
, _
guided _
by _
due _
process _

The _
raid OCCURRENCE
was _
necessary _
because _
the _
Gonzalez _
relatives _
in _
Miami _
, _
refusing OCCURRENCE
to _
return OCCURRENCE
the _
boy _
, _
made _
him _
into _
a _
symbol _
of _
resistance _
to _
Fidel _
Castro _
. _
Elian _
printed OCCURRENCE
his _
name _
on _
an _
application _
for _
asylum _

was _
put OCCURRENCE

say REPORTING

he _
did _
not _
want I_STATE

the _

an _

support _

his _
regime _

Juan _
Miguel _
Gonzalez _
apparently _
is _
a _
Castro _
supporter _

that _

not _
disqualify OCCURRENCE
him _
