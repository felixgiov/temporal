Of _

in _

plunged OCCURRENCE
, _
interest _

soared OCCURRENCE

the _

Washington _
For _
his _
part _
, _
Fidel _
Castro _
is _
the _
ultimate _
political _
survivor _
. _
People _
have _
predicted I_ACTION
his _
demise OCCURRENCE
so _
many _
times _
, _
and _
the _
US _
has _
tried I_ACTION
to _
hasten OCCURRENCE
it _
on _
several _
occasions _
. _
Time _
and _
again _
, _
he _
endures OCCURRENCE
. _
He _
has _
outlasted OCCURRENCE
and _
sometimes _
outsmarted OCCURRENCE
eight _
American _
presidents _
. _
Fidel _
Castro _
invited OCCURRENCE
John _
Paul _
to _
come OCCURRENCE
for _
a _
reason _
. _
This _
is _
clearly _
an _
opportunity _
for _
Cuba _
to _
look _
good _
internationally _
. _
The _
entire _
world _
will _
see PERCEPTION
images _
of _
the _
Pope _
in _
Cuba _
. _
They _
'll _
see PERCEPTION
images _
of _
the _
Pope _
with _
Fidel _
Castro _
. _
It _
will _
give OCCURRENCE
the _
rest _
of _
the _
world _

the _
view _
that _
Cuba _
is _
like _
any _
other _
nation _
, _
something _
the _
US _
has _
, _
of _
course _
, _
tried I_ACTION
to _
persuade I_ACTION
the _
world _
that _
it _
is _
not _
. _
For _
nearly _
forty _
years DURATION
, _
the _
United _
States _
has _
said REPORTING
categorically _
it _
would _
not _
tolerate I_ACTION
totalitarian _
rule _
in _
its _
own _
backyard _
. _
It _
is _
the _
US _
economic _
and _
political _
embargo OCCURRENCE
which _
has _
kept ASPECTUAL
Cuba _
in _
a _
box _
. _
The _
main _
positive _
for _
Castro _
to _
invite OCCURRENCE
the _
Pope _
is _
international _
, _
to _
be _
able I_STATE
to _
say REPORTING
to _
the _
rest _
of _
the _
world _
, _
this _
government _
is _
not _
as _
closed _
, _
as _
intolerant _
, _
uh _
as _
totalitarian _
as _
some _
make I_ACTION
it _
out _
to _
be _
. _
One _
of _
the _
scenarios _
widely _
advanced REPORTING
before _

the _
visit OCCURRENCE
is _
that _
through _
the _
Pope _
, _
Cuba _
, _
still _
led OCCURRENCE
by _
Castro _
, _
can _
begin ASPECTUAL
a _
more _
productive _
relationship _
with _
the _
world _
. _
That _
will _
, _
in _
turn _
, _
bring OCCURRENCE
pressure _
on _
Washington _
to _
change OCCURRENCE
. _
Those _
observers _
looking I_ACTION
for _
a _
battle OCCURRENCE
between _
uncompromising _
representatives _
and _
very _
different _
ideologies _
will _
, _
in _
all _
likelihood _
, _
be _
disappointed STATE
. _
Castro _
has _
said _
that _
you _
can _
be _
a _
Communist _
and _
still _
be _
a _
Christian _
. _
He _
says REPORTING
he _
and _
the _
Pope _
both _
want I_STATE
to _
end ASPECTUAL
the _
exploitation OCCURRENCE
of _
man _
by _
man _
. _
The _
question _
is _
who _
will _
Cubans _
believe STATE
? _
The _
main _
negative _
is _
the _
risk _
that _
the _
Pope _
's _
visit OCCURRENCE
will _
persuade I_ACTION
a _
great _
many _
more _
Cubans _
to _

break OCCURRENCE
loose _
of _
the _
Cuban _
government _
. _
If _
so _
, _
then _
the _
Pope _
's _
visit OCCURRENCE
would _
really _
open ASPECTUAL
up _
a _
new _
chapter _
in _
the _
government _
's _
relations _
with _
its _
own _
society _
. _
For _
the _
Cuban _
government _
, _
that _
is _
the _
risk _
. _

Some _
of _
the _
biggest _

gains _
came OCCURRENCE
in _
the _
construction _
industry _
, _
which _
added OCCURRENCE
92,000 _

The _
increase _
reflected OCCURRENCE
the _
strength _
of _
the _
housing _
industry _
, _
which _
has _
been _
helped OCCURRENCE
not _
just _
by _
declining _
interest _

Service _
industries _

showed OCCURRENCE
solid _

be _
hardest _
hit OCCURRENCE
when _
the _
effects _
of _
the _
Asian _
crisis _
hit OCCURRENCE
the _
American _
economy _
. _
The _
major _
harm OCCURRENCE
from _
Asia _
is _
likely _
to _
come _
from _
the _
plunge OCCURRENCE
in _
the _
value _
of _
many _
Asian _
currencies _
relative _
to _
the _

, _
a _
situation _
that _
is _
expected I_STATE
to _
lead OCCURRENCE
to _
a _
surge OCCURRENCE
of _
inexpensive _
imports _
into _
the _
United _
States _
, _
hurting OCCURRENCE

American _
competitors _
. _
And _
the _
weakness _
of _
the _
Asian _
economies _
is _
also _
likely _
to _
lead OCCURRENCE
to _
decreased _
demand _
for _
American _
exports _
. _
" _
The _
economy _
has _
been _
running OCCURRENCE
on _
the _
fumes _
of _
the _
strength _
from _
before _
the _
Asia _
shock _
, _
" _
McCulley _
said REPORTING
. _
" _
Those _
fumes _
will _
exhaust OCCURRENCE
themselves _
, _
and _
the _
manufacturing _
sector _
is _
going _
to _
start ASPECTUAL
getting _
beat OCCURRENCE
up _

The _
Supreme _
Court _
took OCCURRENCE
a _
detour _
this _
week DATE
from _
the _
core _
principle _

gender _
fairness _
it _
vindicated OCCURRENCE
two _

ruling OCCURRENCE
invalidating I_ACTION
the _
use OCCURRENCE

sexual _

stereotypes _

justify _
denying _
women _
admission _
to _
the _
Virginia _
Military _
Institute _
. _
By _
a _
6 _
- _
3 _
vote _
, _
the _
court _
upheld OCCURRENCE
a _
discriminatory _
immigration _
law _
that _
gives _
a _
child _
born _
overseas _
to _
an _
unmarried _
American _
woman _
a _
better _
chance _
at _
citizenship _
than _
a _
child _
born _
to _
an _
unmarried _
American _
man _
. _
Under _
the _
statute _
, _
a _
child _
born _
abroad _
to _
an _
unwed _
American _
mother _
is _
automatically _
considered _
a _
U.S. _
citizen _
. _
But _
the _
child _
of _
an _
unwed _
American _
father _
has _
no _
citizenship _
rights _
unless _
the _
father _
takes _
the _
affirmative _
step _
of _
acknowledging _
paternity _
and _
formally _
agrees _
to _
provide _
support _
until _
the _
child _
turns _
18 _
. _
The _
majority _

views _
were _
expressed OCCURRENCE
in _
three _
separate _
opinions _

, _
the _
most _
disquieting _
of _
which _
was _
written OCCURRENCE
by _
a _
liberal _
member _
, _
Justice _
John _
Paul _
Stevens _
, _
and _
joined OCCURRENCE
by _
a _
conservative _
, _
Chief _
Justice _
William _
Rehnquist _
. _
The _
opinion _
, _
which _
found I_STATE
the _
gender _
distinction _
reasonable _
, _
relied I_STATE
heavily _
on _
outmoded _
generalities _
about _
family _
roles _
, _
including _
the _
flawed _
presumption _
that _
mothers _
have _
a _
closer _
relationship _
to _
their _
children _
than _
fathers _
do _
. _
As _
Justice _
Stephen _
Breyer _
asked OCCURRENCE
in _
a _
strong _
dissent OCCURRENCE
, _
" _
what _
sense _
does _
it _
make _
" _
to _
apply _
citizenship _
barriers _
" _
only _
to _
fathers _
and _
not _
to _
mothers _
in _
today _
's _
world _
_ _
where _
paternity _
can _
readily _
be _
proved _
and _
where _
women _
and _
men _
both _

are _
likely _
to _
earn _
a _
living _
in _
the _
workplace _
? _
" _
. _
Justices _
Sandra _
Day _
O'Connor _
and _
Anthony _
Kennedy _
seemed _
to _
agree I_ACTION
that _
the _
law _
amounted OCCURRENCE
to _
unconstitutional _
sex _
discrimination _
. _
Butinstead _
of _
providing I_ACTION
the _
votes _
to _
strike OCCURRENCE
it _
down _
, _
they _
chose I_ACTION
to _
uphold OCCURRENCE
it _
on _
the _
flimsy _
ground _
that _
because _
the _
sex _
of _
the _
parent _
and _
not _
the _
child _
made _
the _
difference _
under _
the _
law _
, _
the _
plaintiff _
did _
not _
have _
standing _

bring OCCURRENCE
the _

The _
Justice _
Department _
, _
which _
supported OCCURRENCE
the _
statute _
, _
did _
not _
cover OCCURRENCE
itself _
with _
glory _
either _
. _
The _
department _
retreated OCCURRENCE
from _
its _
position _
in _
the _
VMI _
case _
when _
it _
argued OCCURRENCE
that _
the _

policy OCCURRENCE

" _
As _

it _
managed I_ACTION

splintered _
ruling _
to _
cast OCCURRENCE
doubt _
both _

it _
upheld _

true _

The _
instruction _
is _
in _
English _
for _
most _
classes _
, _
in _
Arabic _
for _
language _
and _
religious _
studies _
. _
The _
school _
says _
it _
teaches _
the _
children _
to _
be _
good _
Muslims _

good _
students _
. _
They _
're _
learning _
a _
civics _
lesson _
from _
the _
residents _

Loudon _
county _

The _
Islamic _
Saudi _
Academy _
has _
twelve _
hundred _

American _
students _

would _
take OCCURRENCE
thirty _

five _
hundred _

The _
academy _
bought OCCURRENCE
a _

asked I_ACTION

In _

Some _

Muslims _

he _

he _
has STATE
a _
big _
problem _
with _
a _
Saudi _

The _
Saudi _
Arabian _
government _
has _
an _
atrocious _

to _
be _
one _

the _

The _

the _
Kuwaiti _

triggers ASPECTUAL
steps _
for _
the _
collective _
enforcement OCCURRENCE

Mr. _

declined OCCURRENCE
to _
use OCCURRENCE
the _
word _
blockade _
, _
but _
said REPORTING
that _
" _
interdiction I_ACTION

of _
Iraqi _

would _
begin ASPECTUAL
" _
almost _
instantly _

" _
In _
a _
statement OCCURRENCE
, _
the _
White _

said REPORTING
it _
would _
do OCCURRENCE
" _
whatever _
is _
necessary _
" _
to _
ensure I_ACTION
compliance _
with _
the _

Other _
Bush _
administration _
officials _
said REPORTING
that _
the _
international _
naval _
force _
in _
the _
area _
-- _
consisting _
of _
American _
, _
British _
, _
French _
, _
Canadian _
, _
Soviet _
, _
German _
and _
Australian _
ships _
-- _
may _
be _
used OCCURRENCE
both _
to _
stop ASPECTUAL
oil _
exports _
from _
leaving OCCURRENCE
Iraq _
and _
Kuwait _
and _
to _
stop ASPECTUAL
shipments _
of _
food _
and _
other _
goods _
from _
going OCCURRENCE
in _
. _
President _
Bush _
implied OCCURRENCE
as _
much _
yesterday DATE
when _
reporters _
asked I_ACTION
whether _
the _
interdiction OCCURRENCE
would _
apply OCCURRENCE
to _
food _

. _
The _
president _
responded REPORTING
, _
" _
Everything _
, _
everything _
. _
" _
While _
shying OCCURRENCE
away _
from _
actually _
using OCCURRENCE
the _
word _
" _
blockade _
, _
" _
Mr. _
Bush _
acknowledged REPORTING
that _
the _
U.S. _
and _
others _
were _
trying I_ACTION
to _
block ASPECTUAL
shipping OCCURRENCE
to _
Iraq _
. _
" _
No _
point _
getting _
into _
all _
these _
semantics _
, _
" _
he _
said REPORTING
. _
" _
The _
main _
thing _
is _
to _
stop ASPECTUAL
the _
oil _
from _
coming OCCURRENCE
out _
of _
there _
. _
" _
The _
naval _
interdiction _
force _
is _
part _
of _
an _
overall _
American _
strategy _
that _
officials _
say _
is _
designed _
to _
leave _
the _
Iraqi _
leader _
with _
only _
the _
stark _
choice _
of _
backing _
out _
of _
Kuwait _
or _
launching _
new _
attacks _
to _
change _
his _
situation _
. _
Though _
they _
insist _
they _
are _
n't _
trying I_ACTION
to _
lure _

Saddam _
Hussein _
into _
an _
attack _
, _
officials _
hope _
that _
if _
he _
strikes _
again _
, _
the _
U.S. _
and _
its _
allies _
will _
have _
such _
an _
impressive _
force _
in _
place _
in _
Saudi _
Arabia _
that _
they _
will _
be _
able _
to _
crush _
him _
in _
retaliation _
. _
Iraq _
's _
first _
option _
, _
of _
course _
, _
may _
be _
simply _
to _
sit _
tight _
and _
hope _
it _
can _
endure _
a _
trade _
embargo _
longer _
than _
the _
West _
can _
live _
without _
Iraqi _
and _
Kuwaiti _
oil _
. _
Speaking _
on _
the _
ABC _
program _
, _
Abdul _
Amir _
al _
- _
Anbari _
, _
Iraq _
's _
ambassador _
to _
the _
U.N. _
, _
asserted _
that _
an _
embargo _
on _
Iraq _
could _
plunge _
the _
U.S. _
into _
a _
" _
depression _
" _

and _
the _
rest _
of _
the _
world _
into _
an _
economic _
" _
crisis _
. _
" _
Iraq _
clearly _
is _
trying _
to _
woo OCCURRENCE
back _
more _
Arab _
support OCCURRENCE
in _
case _
the _
conflict STATE
drags OCCURRENCE
on _
, _
hoping I_STATE
that _
its _
neighbors _
eventually _
will _
help OCCURRENCE
it _
survive OCCURRENCE
a _
prolonged _
war STATE
of _
economic _
attrition _
with _
the _
West _
. _
So _
Saddam _
Hussein _
on _
Friday DATE
tried I_ACTION
to _
scare OCCURRENCE
other _
Arab _
leaders _
into _
supporting OCCURRENCE
him _
by _
calling OCCURRENCE
on _
Arabs _
to _
rise ASPECTUAL
up _
in _
a _
holy _
war STATE
against _
leaders _
who _
invited OCCURRENCE
American _
and _
other _
Western _
soldiers _
into _
Saudi _
Arabia _
to _
protect OCCURRENCE
the _
oil _
- _
rich _
kingdom _
. _
Then _
yesterday DATE
, _
he _
tried I_ACTION
to _
entice OCCURRENCE
Arab _
leaders _
with _
his _
proposal OCCURRENCE
for _
a _
diplomatic _
solution _
linking OCCURRENCE
his _
occupation OCCURRENCE
of _
Kuwait _
with _
Israel _
's _
occupation OCCURRENCE
of _

the _
West _
Bank _
. _
The _
proposal OCCURRENCE
also _
called I_ACTION
for _
replacing OCCURRENCE
American _
and _
other _
Western _
troops _
in _
Saudi _
Arabia _
with _
Arab _
forces _
. _
The _
Bush _
administration _
immediately _
said REPORTING
it _
" _
categorically _
" _
rejects OCCURRENCE
the _
proposals OCCURRENCE
. _
And _
President _
Bush _
yesterday DATE
, _
asked I_ACTION
whether _
he _
was _
at _
least _
glad _
Iraq _
is _
discussing OCCURRENCE
negotiations OCCURRENCE
, _
replied REPORTING
: _
" _
I _
do _
n't _
see PERCEPTION
anything _
to _
be _
pleasing OCCURRENCE
in _
there _
at _
all _
. _
" _
American _
strategists _
are _
calculating _
, _
though _
, _
that _
the _
trade _
sanctions _
-- _
enforced _
by _
an _
effective _
though _
perhaps _
undeclared _
naval _
blockade _
-- _
will _
hold _
tightly _
enough _
to _
convince _
Iraq _
that _
it _
will _
lose _
in _
the _
long _
run _
by _
simply _
standing _
pat _
. _
At _
that _
point _

, _
rather _
than _
go OCCURRENCE
through _
the _
humiliation _
of _
backing OCCURRENCE
out _
of _
Kuwait _
, _
the _
Iraqis _
might _
well _
conclude OCCURRENCE
that _
they _
need OCCURRENCE
to _
lash OCCURRENCE
out _
in _
some _
way _
to _
shake OCCURRENCE
things _
up _
. _
In _
that _
event _
, _
Saddam _
Hussein _
appears OCCURRENCE
to _
have OCCURRENCE
three _
choices _
. _
The _
first _
would _
be _
to _
launch ASPECTUAL
the _
much _
- _
feared _
direct _
invasion OCCURRENCE
of _
Saudi _
Arabia _
, _
hoping I_STATE
to _
seize OCCURRENCE
some _
Saudi _
oil _
fields _
and _
improve OCCURRENCE
his _
bargaining _
position _
. _
But _
that _
option _
is _
growing OCCURRENCE
less _
and _
less _
likely _
as _
thousands _
of _
American _
, _
British _
, _
Egyptian _
, _
Syrian _
and _
Moroccan _
forces _
assemble OCCURRENCE
in _
and _
around _
Saudi _
Arabia _
to _
protect OCCURRENCE
the _
kingdom _
. _
The _
Saudis _
even _
have _
in _
their _
possession _
48 _
Kuwaiti _
jet _
fighters _
, _
virtually _
the _
entire _
Kuwaiti _

air _
force _
, _
which _
managed I_ACTION
to _
escape OCCURRENCE
the _
Iraqi _
invasion OCCURRENCE
, _
Saudi _
officials _
said REPORTING
. _
The _
Saudi _
" _
window _
of _
vulnerability _
... _
is _
closing OCCURRENCE
very _
fast _
, _
" _
Prince _
Bandar _
bin _
Sultan _
, _
the _
Saudi _
ambassador _
to _
Washington _
, _
said REPORTING
over _
the _
weekend DATE
. _
The _
second _
possibility _
would _
be _
to _
start ASPECTUAL
a _
fight OCCURRENCE
with _
Israel _
, _
in _
hopes _
that _
all _
Arabs _
would _
have _
to _
move OCCURRENCE
behind _
Iraq _
in _
a _
fight OCCURRENCE
against _
their _
common _
Israeli _
enemy _
. _
In _
such _
an _
event _
, _
Saddam _
Hussein _
also _
might _
calculate OCCURRENCE
, _
the _
Saudis _
would _
be _
under _
pressure _
to _
kick OCCURRENCE
out _
U.S. _
troops _
because _
of _
America _
's _
close _
ties _
with _
Israel _
. _
Iraq _
could _
start ASPECTUAL
hostilities OCCURRENCE
with _
Israel _
either _
through _
a _
direct _
attack OCCURRENCE

or _
by _
attacking OCCURRENCE
Jordan _
. _
Israel _
has _
publicly _
declared REPORTING
that _
it _
will _
respond OCCURRENCE
to _
an _
Iraqi _
attack OCCURRENCE
on _
Jordan _
because _
it _
wo _
n't _
allow OCCURRENCE
Iraq _
's _
dangerous _
army _
to _
take OCCURRENCE
control _
of _
Jordan _
's _
long _
border _
with _
Israel _
. _
Iraq _
's _
third _
attack _
option _
would _
be _
to _
start ASPECTUAL
an _
undeclared _
war STATE
on _
the _
U.S. _
and _
other _
Western _
nations _
through _
terrorism _
. _
Two _
Middle _
East _
terrorists _
with _
records _
of _
successful _
attacks _
against _
Western _
targets _
, _
Abu _
Nidal _
and _
Abu _
Abbas _
, _
have _
ties _
to _
Baghdad _
. _
And _
even _
terrorist _
groups _
that _
opposed _
Iraq _
in _
its _
war _
with _
Iran _
show _
signs _
of _
swinging _
behind _
Saddam _
Hussein _
now DATE
that _
he _
is _
in _
a _
confrontation _
with _
the _

U.S. _
And _
Iraq _
still _
has OCCURRENCE
thousands _
of _
Americans _
and _
other _
Westerners _
under _
its _
control _
in _
Iraq _
and _
Kuwait _
. _
They _
are _
n't _
being _
allowed OCCURRENCE
to _
leave OCCURRENCE
and _
could _
become OCCURRENCE
hostages _
. _
If _
Iraq _
chooses _
a _
simple _
war _
of _
nerves _
and _
economic _
attrition _
, _
the _
Bush _
administration _
knows _
a _
long _
stalemate _
could _
try _
the _
patience _
of _
the _
American _
public _
and _
the _
West _
in _
general _
, _
and _
could _
open _
the _
possibility _
that _
moderate _
Arabs _
-- _
even _
including _
Saudi _
Arabia _
-- _
might _
drop _
out _
of _
the _
effort _
against _
Iraq _
and _
accept _
some _
deal _
from _
Saddam _
Hussein _
. _
But _
U.S. _
officials _
have _
sized OCCURRENCE
up _
Saddam _
Hussein _
as _
a _
man _
who _
, _
despite _
some _
recklessness _
, _

will _
back OCCURRENCE
down _
if _
he _
must _
. _
" _
This _
is _
a _
guy _
who _
is _
impulsive _
, _
and _
therefore _
capable _
of _
big _
miscalculations _
, _
" _
says REPORTING
one _
senior _
administration _
official _
involved _
in _
managing OCCURRENCE
the _
crisis STATE
. _
The _
official _
adds REPORTING
, _
though _
, _
that _
" _
at _
the _
same _
time _
, _
we _
think I_STATE
he _
is _
someone _
who _
is _
capable STATE
of _
rational _
judgments _
when _
it _
comes _
to _
power _
. _
And _
when _
he _
finds OCCURRENCE
something _
is _
unprofitable _
, _
then _
one _
can _
see PERCEPTION
certain _
accommodations OCCURRENCE
. _
" _
Thus _
, _
administration _
aides _
will _
be _
trying I_ACTION
to _
calculate OCCURRENCE
whether _
Saddam _
Hussein _
's _
proposed _
diplomatic _
formula _
for _
getting OCCURRENCE
out _
of _
Kuwait _
represents OCCURRENCE
the _
first _
sign _
he _
is _
searching OCCURRENCE
for _
a _
way _
out _
or _
simply _
is _
a _

public _
relations _
stunt OCCURRENCE
. _
There _
are _
disagreements _
among _
experts _
about _
how _
much _
pressure _
will _
be _
needed _
to _
make _
Saddam _
Hussein _
decide _
he _
's _
up _
against _
the _
wall _
and _
whether _
simple _
economic _
pressure _
will _
ever _
be _
enough _
. _
The _
biggest _
worry _
is _
that _
if _
he _
decides _
he _
needs _
a _
way _
out _
of _
his _
predicament _
but _
does _
n't _
see PERCEPTION
a _
face _
- _
saving _
method _
, _
he _
could _
lash _
out _
in _
dangerous _
and _
unpredictable _
ways _
. _
U.S. _
officials _
claim _
they _
already _
see _
signs _
Saddam _
Hussein _
is _
getting _
nervous _
. _
In _
the _
first _
days _
after _
President _
Bush _
announced REPORTING
the _
dispatching OCCURRENCE
of _
U.S. _
troops _
, _
they _
note _
, _
the _
Iraqi _
leader _
made OCCURRENCE
several _
nationwide _
addresses OCCURRENCE
indirectly _
-- _
having _

them _
read OCCURRENCE
by _
a _
television _
announcer _
. _
" _
That _
shows OCCURRENCE
he _
's _
nervous _
about _
pinpointing OCCURRENCE
his _
location _
, _
either _
because _
he _
's _
afraid _
we _
'll _
find OCCURRENCE
him _
, _
or _
that _
internal _
enemies _
will _
, _
" _
says REPORTING
one _
U.S. _
official _
. _
The _
unpredictability _
of _
Iraq _
's _
leader _
is _
a _
principal _
reason _
the _
U.S. _
is _
going _
to _
such _
great _
lengths _
to _
build _
a _
mammoth _
force _
in _
and _
around _
Saudi _
Arabia _
. _
Pentagon _
officials _
say REPORTING
the _
goal _
is _
to _
put OCCURRENCE
40,000 _
troops _
in _
the _
region _
by _
the _
end _
of _
the _
month DATE
. _
But _
the _
administration _
is _
n't _
putting OCCURRENCE
any _
upper _
limit _
on _
how _
high _
the _
force _
could _
go OCCURRENCE
after _
that _

, _
calculating OCCURRENCE
that _
it _
would _
be _
a _
mistake OCCURRENCE
to _
underestimate OCCURRENCE
and _
an _
advantage _
to _
keep ASPECTUAL
Saddam _
Hussein _
guessing OCCURRENCE
. _
U.S. _
commanders _
in _
charge _
of _
planning OCCURRENCE
for _
Middle _
East _
crises STATE
have _
indicated REPORTING
in _
the _
past DATE
that _
they _
were _
capable OCCURRENCE
of _
deploying OCCURRENCE
as _
many _
as _
300,000 _
troops _
. _
And _
the _
U.S. _
is _
taking OCCURRENCE
similar _
steps _
to _
ensure OCCURRENCE
that _
its _
naval _
force _
is _
adequate STATE
to _
carry OCCURRENCE
out _
a _
blockade STATE
of _
Iraq _
and _
support OCCURRENCE
a _
war STATE
if _
necessary _
. _
Over _
the _
weekend DATE
, _
Pentagon _
officials _
confirmed REPORTING
reports _
that _
a _
fourth _
U.S. _
aircraft _
carrier _
-- _
the _
John _
F. _
Kennedy _
-- _
and _
its _
powerful _
group _
of _
support _
ships _
could _
head OCCURRENCE
for _
the _
Middle _
East _
within _

a _
few _

Three _

But _
unless _
the _
military _
situation _
changes OCCURRENCE
drastically _
, _
military _
officials _
say REPORTING

the _
most _
likely _
plan _

be _
for _

Kennedy _

eventually _
replace OCCURRENCE
the _

Dwight _
D. _

continued _
military _

carries OCCURRENCE
political _

diplomatic _
risks _

Of _

it _

the _

stay OCCURRENCE
as _
smooth _
for _

it _

Iraq _
still _
has OCCURRENCE
the _
potential _
to _

significant _
problems _
by _
using OCCURRENCE
forces _

Iraq _
still _
apparently _

unleashed OCCURRENCE
its _

chemical _
weapons _

Gen. _
Schwarzkopf _
said REPORTING
that _
some _
early _
reports _
that _
chemical _

used OCCURRENCE
against _
allied _

turned OCCURRENCE
out _

" _
Iraq _
is _
believed OCCURRENCE
to _
have OCCURRENCE
the _
ability _

chemical _
weapons _
in _
artillery _
shells _
or _
, _
perhaps _
, _
atop _
Soviet _

made _

. _
Perhaps _
more _
important _
, _
it _
appears OCCURRENCE
that _
allied _
troops _
have _
n't _
yet _
fully _
engaged OCCURRENCE
Iraq _
's _
vaunted _
Republican _
Guard _
, _
which _
has _
been _
sitting OCCURRENCE
just _
north _
of _
the _
Iraq _

Kuwait _
border _
and _
is _
considered I_STATE
the _
most _
potent _
element _

It _
remains STATE
to _
be _
seen PERCEPTION
how _
much _
damage OCCURRENCE
the _
allied _
air _
campaign OCCURRENCE
was _
able _
to _
inflict OCCURRENCE

whether _

commit OCCURRENCE
his _
most _

a _

to _
fight OCCURRENCE
on _

" _

he _

in _
a _
radio _

" _
All _

" _
American _
war _
planners _
have _
long _
assumed OCCURRENCE
that _
the _
early _
stage _
of _
the _
ground _
attack OCCURRENCE
, _
in _
which _
American _
forces _
would _
use OCCURRENCE
their _
speed _
to _
sweep OCCURRENCE
around _
Iraqi _
defenses _
and _
their _
strength _
to _
punch OCCURRENCE
through _
the _
relatively _
weak _
Iraqi _
front _
line _
, _
would _
be _
the _
easiest _
part _
. _
Despite _
these _
early _
successes _
, _
the _
mere _
fact _
that _
a _
ground _
campaign OCCURRENCE

has _
begun I_ACTION
almost _
guarantees OCCURRENCE
that _
the _
Bush _
administration _
will _
face OCCURRENCE
fresh _
problems _
growing OCCURRENCE
out _
of _
the _
military _
situation STATE

There _
are _
likely _

additional _
American _
prisoners _

taking OCCURRENCE
Kuwaiti _

Kuwaiti _
officials _

there _
are _

being _
rounded OCCURRENCE
up _

either _

as _
human _
shields _
or _
for _
use OCCURRENCE
later _
in _
bargaining OCCURRENCE
once _
the _
war STATE
is _
over _
. _
President _
Bush _
's _
political _
argument _
for _
going OCCURRENCE
to _
a _
ground _
war OCCURRENCE
has _
been _
strengthened OCCURRENCE
by _
the _
growing _
stream _
of _
reports _
of _
wanton _
Iraqi _
destruction OCCURRENCE
inside _
Kuwait _
. _
U.S. _

officials _
say REPORTING
that _
hundreds _

Kuwaiti _
oil _

And _
Robert _
Gates _
, _
Mr. _

asserted REPORTING

fire _

Mr. _
Bush _
and _
his _
aides _
were _
leaning PERCEPTION
toward _
a _
military _
conclusion ASPECTUAL
of _
the _
crisis STATE
even _
before _
the _
latest _
reports _
of _
Iraqi _
atrocities OCCURRENCE
in _
Kuwait _
came OCCURRENCE
to _
light _
. _
The _
president _
and _
his _
top _
aides _
tentatively _
decided OCCURRENCE
on _
Feb. _
11 DATE
that _
a _
ground _
war OCCURRENCE
would _
be _
necessary STATE
. _
The _
decision OCCURRENCE
was _
made OCCURRENCE
after _
Defense _
Secretary _
Dick _
Cheney _
and _
Gen. _
Colin _
Powell _
, _
chairman _
of _
the _
Joint _
Chiefs _

of _
Staff _
, _
returned OCCURRENCE
from _
a _
visit OCCURRENCE
with _
military _
commanders _
in _
Saudi _
Arabia _
, _
administration _
officials _
say REPORTING
. _
Then _
, _
a _
week _
or _
so _
ago DATE
, _
Gen. _
Schwarzkopf _
secretly _
picked OCCURRENCE
Saturday _
night TIME
as _
the _
optimal _
time _
to _
start ASPECTUAL
the _
offensive OCCURRENCE
. _
The _
date _
was _
unaffected OCCURRENCE
by _
the _
last _
- _
ditch _
Soviet _
peace _
initiative OCCURRENCE
. _
The _
real _
problem _
with _
the _
Soviet _
proposals _
, _
U.S. _
officials _
now _
say REPORTING
, _
was _
that _
they _
all _
would _
have _
required OCCURRENCE
lifting OCCURRENCE
economic _
sanctions OCCURRENCE
against _
Iraq _
. _
The _
Bush _
administration _
considers I_STATE
the _
sanctions OCCURRENCE
essential _
to _
keeping ASPECTUAL
Saddam _
Hussein _
under _
control _
should _
he _
survive OCCURRENCE
the _
war STATE
. _
Mr. _
Bush _
forestalled OCCURRENCE
further _
diplomatic _
maneuvering OCCURRENCE
by _
issuing OCCURRENCE
an _
ultimatum _
on _
behalf _
of _
the _
allies _
demanding OCCURRENCE
that _

Iraq _
withdraw OCCURRENCE
within _
a _
week DURATION
, _
starting ASPECTUAL
at _
noon _
Saturday TIME
. _
Administration _
aides _
said REPORTING
that _
the _
idea _
of _
the _
ultimatum _
was _
Gen. _
Powell _
's _
. _
He _
argued OCCURRENCE
setting OCCURRENCE
an _
explicit _
deadline _
for _
Saddam _
Hussein _
to _
break OCCURRENCE
would _
, _
when _
it _
was _
broken OCCURRENCE
, _
give OCCURRENCE
the _
U.S. _
military _
a _
clear _
green _
light _
to _
proceed OCCURRENCE
. _
In _
setting OCCURRENCE
out _
his _
final _
challenge _
to _
Saddam _
Hussein _
, _
Mr. _
Bush _
continued ASPECTUAL
the _
intensive _
personal _
diplomacy OCCURRENCE
he _
began I_ACTION
after _
the _
invasion OCCURRENCE
last _
August DATE
. _
After _
cabling OCCURRENCE
world _
leaders _
about _
his _
intention _
to _
give OCCURRENCE
Saddam _
Hussein _
a _
final _
deadline _
to _
exit OCCURRENCE
Kuwait _
, _
he _
offered I_ACTION
him _
a _
week DURATION
to _
withdraw OCCURRENCE
fully _
, _
instead _
of _
the _
four _
days DURATION
he _
originally _
considered I_STATE
, _
because _
of _
objections OCCURRENCE

from _
some _
European _
partners _
that _
four _
days _
seemed PERCEPTION
punitive _
and _
unrealistic _
. _
And _
when _
he _
and _
President _
Gorbachev _
spoke OCCURRENCE
about _
the _
decision OCCURRENCE
in _
a _
talk OCCURRENCE
lasting _
nearly _
an _
hour DURATION
, _
the _
President _
took OCCURRENCE
pains _
to _
listen PERCEPTION
to _
what _
his _
counterpart _
had _
to _
say REPORTING
, _
although _
he _
already _
had _
decided OCCURRENCE
that _
the _
Soviet _
alternative _
to _
the _
allied _
deadline _
was _
unacceptable STATE
. _
Finally _
, _
when _
Iraq _
failed OCCURRENCE
to _
respond OCCURRENCE
to _
the _
U.S. _
ultimatum _
, _
Mr. _
Bush _
let OCCURRENCE
the _
ground _
offensive OCCURRENCE
begin I_ACTION
as _
previously _
planned I_STATE
Saturday _
night TIME
. _
The _
attack OCCURRENCE
was _
lightning _
quick _
, _
as _
allied _
forces _
punched OCCURRENCE
through _
tall _
sand _
berms _
on _
the _
border _
and _
pushed OCCURRENCE
forward _
into _
Iraq _
and _
Kuwait _
. _
U.S. _
Marines _

were _
said REPORTING
to _
have _
breached I_STATE
troublesome _
mine _
fields _
along _
the _
Iraqi _
lines _
but _
Pentagon _
officials _
said REPORTING
no _
amphibious _
assault OCCURRENCE
on _
Kuwait _
's _
beaches _
had _
begun I_ACTION
. _
Long _
columns _
of _
Iraqi _
prisoners _
of _
war _
could _
be _
seen PERCEPTION
trudging OCCURRENCE
through _
the _
desert _
toward _
the _
allied _
rear _
. _
U.S. _
commanders _
said REPORTING
5,500 _
Iraqi _
prisoners _
were _
taken OCCURRENCE
in _
the _
first _
hours DURATION
of _
the _
ground _
war STATE
, _
though _
some _
military _
officials _
later _
said REPORTING
the _
total _
may _
have _
climbed OCCURRENCE
above _
8,000 _
. _
The _
U.S. _
hopes I_STATE
its _
troops _
will _
drive OCCURRENCE
Iraqi _
forces _
out _
of _
Kuwait _
quickly _
, _
leaving OCCURRENCE
much _
of _
Iraq _
's _
offensive _
military _
equipment _
destroyed OCCURRENCE
or _
abandoned STATE
in _
Kuwait _
. _
It _
expects I_STATE
that _
tens _
of _
thousands _
of _

Iraqi _
soldiers _
will _
surrender OCCURRENCE
to _
the _
U.S. _
and _
its _
allies _
over _
the _
next _
few _
days DURATION
. _
If _
the _
allies _
succeed OCCURRENCE
, _
Saddam _
Hussein _
will _
have _
plunged OCCURRENCE
his _
country _
first _
into _
a _
fruitless _
eight _
- _
year DURATION
war STATE
against _
Iran _
and _
then _
into _
a _
humiliating _
war OCCURRENCE
against _
the _
U.S. _
and _
the _
allies _
to _
defend OCCURRENCE
his _
conquest OCCURRENCE
of _
Kuwait _
, _
leaving OCCURRENCE
much _
of _
his _
country _
's _
military _
establishment _
and _
modern _
infrastructure _
in _
ruins _
. _
Meanwhile _
, _
the _
U.S. _
hopes I_STATE
, _
economic _
sanctions OCCURRENCE
and _
an _
international _
arms _
embargo OCCURRENCE
will _
remain STATE
in _
effect _
until _
Iraq _
pays OCCURRENCE
war _
reparations _
to _
Kuwait _
to _
cover OCCURRENCE
war _
damages _
. _
That _
would _
undermine OCCURRENCE
any _
chances _
of _
rebuilding OCCURRENCE
either _
Iraq _
or _
its _

armed _
forces _
in _
short _
order _
as _
long _
as _
Saddam _
Hussein _
remains STATE
in _
power _
. _
The _
American _
hope _
is _
that _
someone _
from _
within _
Iraq _
, _
perhaps _
from _
the _
army _
's _
professional _
ranks _
, _
will _
step _
forward _
and _
push _
Saddam _
Hussein _
aside _
so _
that _
the _
country _
can _
begin _
recovering _
from _
the _
disaster _
. _
Outside _
analysts _
think I_STATE
Saddam _
Hussein _
's _
position _
is _
indeed _
precarious _
. _
" _
I _
think _
frankly _
Saddam _
is _
finished OCCURRENCE
, _
no _
matter _
what _
happens OCCURRENCE
, _
" _
says REPORTING
Christine _
Helms _
, _
a _
Middle _
East _
scholar _
who _
has _
written OCCURRENCE
extensively _
about _
Iraq _
. _
" _
These _
guys _
simply _
do _
n't _
retire OCCURRENCE
to _
condos _
over _
the _
Euphrates _
. _
" _
Despite _
the _
lack _
of _
any _
obvious _
successors _
, _
the _
Iraqi _
leader _

's _
internal _
power _
base _
appeared OCCURRENCE
to _
be _
narrowing OCCURRENCE
even _
before _
the _
war STATE
began ASPECTUAL
. _
Some _
analysts _
say REPORTING
he _
appeared OCCURRENCE
to _
be _
relying OCCURRENCE
on _
a _
smaller _
and _
smaller _
circle _
of _
close _
advisers _
and _
relatives _
. _
If _
that _
's _
true _
, _
the _
narrowing _
of _
his _
support _
would _
make OCCURRENCE
it _
easier _
for _
someone _
to _
push OCCURRENCE
him _
aside _
from _
within _
. _
Yet _
, _
paradoxically _
, _
the _
perception _
that _
the _
U.S. _
wants I_STATE
to _
destroy OCCURRENCE
Iraq _
may _
increase OCCURRENCE
Saddam _
Hussein _
's _
support _
within _
the _
Iraqi _
military _
. _
And _
the _
U.S. _
now _
will _
face OCCURRENCE
sharper _
questions _
in _
the _
Arab _
world _
since _
it _
did _
n't _
back OCCURRENCE
the _

" _

reported REPORTING
slower _

operating _

That _
would _
be _
a _
huge _
problem STATE
if _
it _
were _
to _
continue ASPECTUAL

Unisys _
is _
betting OCCURRENCE

move OCCURRENCE

away _

around _
$ _
4 _

That _

, _

Statistics _
on _

foreigners _
vary _
in _
detail _
, _
because _
unlike _
Sansui _
, _
which _
is _

, _
most _
of _
the _
Japanese _

by _

are _
privately _

But _
by _

accounts _
foreign _

Usually _
when _

it _

the _

Sansui _

The _

because _
the _
