: O
The O
murder B-EVENT
of O
Dr. O
Barnett O
Slepian O
is O
the O
latest O
depraved O
assault B-EVENT
on O
the O
small O
number O
of O
courageous O
physicians O
who O
still O
risk B-EVENT
their O
safety O
to O
perform B-EVENT
legal O
abortions O
in O
this O
country O

. O
Slepian O
was B-EVENT
one O
of O
only O
three O
doctors O
who O
performed B-EVENT
abortions O
in O
the O
Buffalo O
, O
N.Y. O
, O
area O
, O
and O
harassment O
and O
threats O
against O
him O
by O
anti-abortion O
groups O
had O
become B-EVENT
routine O
over O
the O
past B-TIMEX3
decade I-TIMEX3
. O
He O
persevered B-EVENT
through O
courage O
and O
a O
belief O
in O
the O
right O
of O
his O
patients O
to O
choose B-EVENT
whether O
to O
bear B-EVENT
a O
child O
. O
But O
a O
principled O
commitment B-EVENT
to O
provide B-EVENT
a O
constitutionally O
protected O
service B-EVENT
could O
not O
stop B-EVENT
the O
assassin O
's O
bullet O
that O
tore B-EVENT
through O
his O
kitchen O
window O
and O
into O
his O
back O
Friday B-TIMEX3
night O
. O
His O
death O
shows B-EVENT
again O
how O
tentative O
the O
right O
to O
abortion O
has O
become B-EVENT
in O
the O
face O
of O
terrorism B-EVENT
by O
anti-choice O
fanatics O
. O
Their O
repeated O

acts B-EVENT
of O
terrorism O
must O
be O
met B-EVENT
with O
the O
severest O
possible O
crackdown B-EVENT
by O
law O
- O

authorities O
. O
If O
an O

has O
to O

stationed B-EVENT
outside O
every O
abortion O

's O
home O
and O
office O
, O
24 O
hours O
a O
day O
, O
let O
it O
be O
done B-EVENT
. O
This O
is O
an O
assault B-EVENT
not O
only O
on O
individual O
doctors O
but O
on O
the O
rights O
and O
liberties O
of O
all O
Americans O
. O
Last B-TIMEX3
week I-TIMEX3
the O
FBI O
joined B-EVENT
Canadian O
authorities O
to O
investigate B-EVENT
a O
series O
of O
unsolved O
sniper O
shootings B-EVENT
of O
doctors O
in O
Canada O

western O
New O

dating O
to O
1994 B-TIMEX3

In O
January B-TIMEX3

a O
week B-TIMEX3
after O
the O
25th O
anniversary B-EVENT
of O
the O

a O

Since O

, O
three O

, O
including O
Slepian O
, O
three O
clinic O
employees O

a O

more O

a O

of O
abortion O

in O
the O
last B-TIMEX3
five I-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
. O
Arson B-EVENT
and O
bombings B-EVENT
at O
clinics O
have O
become B-EVENT
so O
common O
that O
many O
no O
longer O
make B-EVENT
the O
national O
news O
. O
It O
is B-EVENT
bad O
enough O
that O
conservatives O
in O
Congress O
and O
in O
state O
legislatures O
are O
working B-EVENT
to O
dismantle B-EVENT
reproductive O
rights O
by O
banning B-EVENT
certain O
procedures B-EVENT
, O
such O
as O
so O
- O
called O
partial O
birth O

by O
requiring B-EVENT
waiting O
periods B-EVENT
and O
parental O
consent B-EVENT
before O
an O
abortion O
can O
be O
obtained B-EVENT
. O
But O
those O
restrictions O
are O
at O

imposed B-EVENT
by O
the O
normal O

give O
and O
take O
of O
political O
and O
judicial O
struggle B-EVENT
in O
a O
democracy O
. O
What O
is B-EVENT
outrageous O
is O
the O
attempt B-EVENT
to O
shut B-EVENT
down O
abortions O
by O
illegal O
means O
_ O
by O
shooting B-EVENT
the O
doctors O
or O
bombing B-EVENT
the O
clinics O
or O
harassing B-EVENT
the O
women O
seeking B-EVENT
to O
exercise B-EVENT
their O
constitutional O
right O
. O
Some O
anti-abortion O
groups O
, O
to O
their O
credit O
, O
have O
denounced B-EVENT
the O
bombings B-EVENT
and O
shootings B-EVENT
, O
but O
others O
seem B-EVENT
reluctant O
to O
issue B-EVENT
the O
strong O
condemnations B-EVENT
that O
are O
warranted B-EVENT
. O
Indeed O
, O
one O
particularly O
virulent O

Such O

, O
and O
frequent O
accusations B-EVENT
by O
some O
anti-abortionists O
that O

are O
committing B-EVENT

, O
can O
only O
fuel B-EVENT
more O
terrorism O

The O

and O
ongoing O
campaigns B-EVENT
of O

by O

even O

have O
worked B-EVENT
to O

. O
More O
than O
80 O

In O
45 O

declined B-EVENT
between O
1982 B-TIMEX3

1992 B-TIMEX3

Slepian O
was B-EVENT
among O
those O
who O
took B-EVENT
a O
stand O
against O
restricting B-EVENT
reproductive O
freedom O
and O
paid B-EVENT
with O
his O
life O
. O
Unless O
these O
brave O
doctors O
are O
better O
protected B-EVENT
, O
fewer O
doctors O

in O
the O
next O
generation O
will O
be O
willing B-EVENT
to O
place B-EVENT
themselves O
and O
their O
families O
in O
such O
danger O
. O
That O
is O
what O
the O

in O
explaining B-EVENT
that O
a O

not O

It O
was O
the O
spiritual O

that O
all O

Bronislaw O

the O

Poland O
, O
who O
was B-EVENT
a O
dissident O
during O

Geremek O
said B-EVENT
he O
had O
brought B-EVENT
some O

mementoes O
from O

the O
Truman O

including O
a O

from O
1989 B-TIMEX3
when O
the O

Geremek O

" O
For O
the O

" O
The O
Czech O
foreign O
minister O
, O
Jan O
Kavan O
, O
who O
lived B-EVENT
in O
London O
from O
1968 B-TIMEX3
, O
when O
the O
Soviets O
invaded B-EVENT
Czechoslovakia O
, O
until O
1989 B-TIMEX3
, O
said B-EVENT
he O
had O
remained B-EVENT
buoyant O
during O
his O
opposition O
work B-EVENT
as O
an O
emigre O
by O
believing B-EVENT
that O
communism O
would O
eventually O
fall B-EVENT
. O
But O
he O
never O
dreamed B-EVENT
, O
he O
said B-EVENT
, O
that O
his O
country O
would O
become B-EVENT
a O

member O
of O
NATO O
. O
" O
Accession B-EVENT
to O

a O

will O
never O
again O

powerless O
victims O
of O
any O
foreign O

, O
" O
Kavan O
said B-EVENT
. O
Similarly O
, O
the O
Hungarian O
foreign O
minister O
, O
Janos O
Martonyi O
, O
who O
remembers B-EVENT
the O
1956 B-TIMEX3
uprising B-EVENT
as O
a O
13 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
, O
said B-EVENT
that O
membership O
of O
NATO O
meant B-EVENT
that O
Hungary O
was O
returning B-EVENT
" O
to O
her O
natural O
habitat O
. O
" O
" O
It O
has O
been B-EVENT
our O
manifest O
destiny O

those O
with O

we O
share B-EVENT
the O
same O
values O
, O
interests O
and O

, O
" O
he O
said B-EVENT
. O
But O
Martonyi O
also O
emphasized B-EVENT
that O
Hungary O
understood B-EVENT
NATO O
membership O
carried B-EVENT
with O
it O
obligations O
as O
well O
as O
privileges O
. O
" O
We O
shall O
prove B-EVENT
that O

indeed O
add B-EVENT

of O

" O
he O
said B-EVENT

The O
location O
for O
Friday B-TIMEX3
's I-TIMEX3
ceremony B-EVENT
was O
chosen B-EVENT
by O
Albright O
, O
who O
as O
secretary O
of O
state O
is B-EVENT
the O
depository O
of O
NATO O
's O
accession O
accords O
. O
The O
secretary O
made O
the O
fairly O
unorthodox O
decision B-EVENT
to O
choose B-EVENT
a O
site O
outside O
Washington O
because O
she O
wanted B-EVENT
the O
ceremony B-EVENT
to O
resonate B-EVENT
with O
the O
memories O
of O
President O
Truman O
, O
under O
whom O
NATO O
was O
founded B-EVENT
. O
On O
April B-TIMEX3

of O
the O
United O

secretary O
of O

, O
Dean O
Acheson O
, O
signed B-EVENT
the O
Washington O
Treaty O
, O
which O
created B-EVENT
NATO O
. O
Acheson O
is O
Albright O
's O
favorite O
predecessor O
, O
her O
aides O

said B-EVENT
. O
Formed B-EVENT
in O
reaction O
to O
the O
threat O
of O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
under O
Stalin O
, O
NATO O
calls B-EVENT
for O
the O
collective O
defense B-EVENT
of O
its O
members O
and O
was O
brought B-EVENT
into O
being O
with O
an O
original O
12 O
members O
. O
The O
alliance O
has O
expanded B-EVENT
three O
times O
before O
, O
adding B-EVENT
Greece O
and O
Turkey O
in O
1952 B-TIMEX3
, O
West O
Germany O
in O
1955 B-TIMEX3
and O
Spain O
in O
1982 B-TIMEX3
. O
But O
never O
before O
has O
NATO O
reached B-EVENT
out O
to O
its O
former O
Eastern O

bloc O
enemies O
. O
The O
Clinton O
administration O
embarked B-EVENT
on O
the O
expansion B-EVENT
of O
NATO O
in O
1993 B-TIMEX3
after O
Clinton O
met B-EVENT
in O
Washington O
with O
President O
Havel O
and O
Lech O
Walesa O
, O
who O
was B-EVENT
then O
the O
president O
of O
Poland O
. O
These O
conversations B-EVENT
are O
remembered B-EVENT
by O
Clinton O
's O
foreign O
policy O
team O
because O
they O
took B-EVENT
place O
after O
the O
opening B-EVENT

of O
the O
Holocaust O
Museum O
and O
because O
they O
involved B-EVENT
two O
very O
different O
Central O
European O
leaders O
who O
brought B-EVENT
the O
same O
message O
. O
Their O
message B-EVENT
was O
that O
NATO O
should O
be O
used B-EVENT
as O
the O
mechanism O
to O
secure B-EVENT
the O
democratic O
progress O
of O
their O
countries O
and O
at O
the O
same O
dissuade B-EVENT
Russia O
from O
any O
more O
imperial O
designs O
. O
The O
U.S. O
ambassador O
to O
Poland O
, O
Dan O
Fried O
, O
who O
was B-EVENT
then O
on O
the O
National O
Security O
Council O
, O
said B-EVENT
Friday B-TIMEX3
that O
he O
remembered B-EVENT

asked B-EVENT
to O
help B-EVENT

turn B-EVENT
this O
pious O
wish O
into O
a O
policy O

" O
In O
July B-TIMEX3
1997 I-TIMEX3
, O
at O
a O
summit B-EVENT
in O
Madrid O
, O
Spain O
, O
the O
alliance O
announced B-EVENT
it O
would O
accept B-EVENT
Poland O
, O
Hungary O
and O
the O
Czech O
Republic O
. O
Romania O
and O
Slovenia O
, O
which O
had O

tried B-EVENT
hard O
to O
meet B-EVENT
the O
standards O
, O
were O
turned B-EVENT
away O
, O
at O
least O
for O
the O
time O
being O
. O
One O
problem O
was O
how O
to O
deal B-EVENT
with O
the O
Russians O
, O
who O
vacillated B-EVENT
between O
outright O
hostility O
and O
accepting O
what O
looked B-EVENT
like O
the O
inevitable O
. O
In O
early O
1997 B-TIMEX3
, O
President O
Boris O
Yeltsin O
told B-EVENT
President O
Clinton O
he O
could O
live B-EVENT
with O
NATO O
expansion B-EVENT
. O
But O
in O
order O
to O
accommodate O
the O
Russians O
, O
NATO O
created B-EVENT
the O
NATO O

Russia O
Council O
as O
a O
consultative O
body O
that O
formalized B-EVENT
relations O
between O
Moscow O
and O
the O

Poland O
has O
been B-EVENT
sensitive O
to O
the O
reactions B-EVENT
of O
Russia O
to O
its O
membership O
of O
NATO O
, O
and O
Geremek O
has O
gone B-EVENT
out O
of O
his O
way O
to O
reassure B-EVENT
the O
Russians O
. O
" O
We O
want B-EVENT
our O

membership O

NATO O
to O
serve B-EVENT

a O

co-operation O

ceremony B-EVENT
Friday B-TIMEX3

the O
ministers O
were O
asked B-EVENT
whether O
they O
could O
ever O
foresee B-EVENT
Russia O
as O
a O
member O
of O
NATO O
. O
There O
was O
a O
long O
pause B-EVENT
among O
the O
three O
ministers O

Then O
Martonyi O
replied B-EVENT

With O

, O
the O
authorities O
in O
the O
Buffalo O
, O
N.Y. O
, O
area O
say B-EVENT
they O
have O
gathered B-EVENT
enough O
evidence O
in O
the O
October B-TIMEX3
slaying B-EVENT
of O
Dr. O
Barnett O

Slepian O
to O
begin B-EVENT
presenting B-EVENT
a O

case O
to O
a O
state O
grand O
jury O
as O
early O
as O
next B-TIMEX3

A O
federal O

been O
addressing B-EVENT
the O
slaying B-EVENT
under O
laws O
that O
prohibit B-EVENT

Slepian O

shot B-EVENT

death O
last O
Oct. B-TIMEX3

at O
his O
home O
in O

Amherst O

But O
the O
decision B-EVENT
by O
District O
Attorney O
Frank O
C. O
Clark O
to O
begin B-EVENT
presenting B-EVENT
evidence O
to O
a O
state O
grand O
jury O
suggests B-EVENT
that O
he O
has O
amassed B-EVENT
enough O
material O
to O
support B-EVENT
a O
criminal O
indictment O
for O
homicide O
. O
" O
We O
've O
gotten B-EVENT
to O
the O
point O
where O
we O
know B-EVENT
what O
we O
want B-EVENT
to O
introduce B-EVENT
before O
a O

grand O
jury O
, O
" O
Clark O
said B-EVENT
in O
a O
telephone O
interview B-EVENT
Monday B-TIMEX3
. O
Although O
the O
authorities O
are O
not O
saying B-EVENT
who O
the O
suspect O
is B-EVENT
, O
all O
of O
the O
attention O
so O
far O
has O
fallen B-EVENT
on O
James O
C. O
Kopp O
, O
a O
44 O

anti-abortion O
protester O
who O
had O
been O
traveling B-EVENT

Officially O
, O
Kopp O
is O
being O
sought B-EVENT
as O
a O
" O
material O
witness O
" O
in O
the O
case O
. O
Clark O
said B-EVENT
it O
was O
easier O
to O
seek B-EVENT
extradition B-EVENT
of O
an O
indicted O
suspect O
from O
another O
state O
or O
a O
foreign O
country O
than O
of O
someone O
wanted B-EVENT
as O
a O
material O
witness O
. O
For O
now O
, O
though O
, O
that O
would O
be B-EVENT
a O
theoretical O
advantage O
since O
the O
authorities O
have O
admitted B-EVENT
they O

have B-EVENT
no O
idea O
where O
Kopp O
is B-EVENT
. O
Clark O
said B-EVENT
there O
was O
" O
no O
question O
" O
that O
the O
finding B-EVENT
of O
the O
rifle O
was B-EVENT
important O
in O
his O
decision B-EVENT
to O
seek B-EVENT
an O
indictment B-EVENT
. O
The O
rifle O
was O
discovered B-EVENT
April B-TIMEX3

about O
200 O

It O
is O
undergoing B-EVENT
testing O
at O
the O
FBI O
laboratory O

the O

have O
said B-EVENT
it O
resembles B-EVENT
the O
kind O
of O
high O

used B-EVENT
in O
the O
slaying B-EVENT

Clark O
said B-EVENT
other O
evidence O
that O

might O
present B-EVENT
includes B-EVENT
a O
strand O
of O
human O
hair O
found B-EVENT
at O
the O
wooded O

that O
has O
a O
" O
high O

of O
matching B-EVENT

If O

caught B-EVENT

charged B-EVENT
in O
both O

, O
a O
state O

would O
likely O
precede B-EVENT

one O

the O
authorities O
two O
chances O

Good O
for O
Attorney O
General O
Janet O
Reno O
for O
the O

opinion O
she O
rendered B-EVENT
in O
the O
case O
of O
Elian O
Gonzalez O
. O
Some O
semblance O
of O
constitutional O

order O
was O
necessary O
after O
a O
Miami O
judge O
turned B-EVENT
legal O
logic O
on O
its O
head O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
route B-EVENT

court O

Immigration O
, O
after O

If O

contested B-EVENT
, O
Reno O
ruled B-EVENT
correctly O
that O
the O
only O
proper O
venue O
is O
federal O
court O
, O
not O
state O
or O
local O
. O
If O
and O
when O
the O

' O
appeal B-EVENT
goes B-EVENT
to O
federal O
court O
, O
chances O
of O
a O
favorable O
ruling B-EVENT
are O
slim O
. O
First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
INS O
already O
has O
taken B-EVENT
the O
position O
the O
only O
person O

who O
can O
petition B-EVENT
for O
U.S. O
asylum O
for O
Elian O
is O
his O
father O
, O
which O
he O
is O
not O
about O
to O
do B-EVENT
. O
Moreover O
, O
immigration O
law O
provides B-EVENT
that O
asylum O
can O
only O
be O
granted B-EVENT
where O
there O
is O
an O
imminent O
threat O
of O
torture B-EVENT
or O
persecution B-EVENT
in O
the O
petitioner O

homeland O
, O
which O
nobody O
expects B-EVENT
in O
Elian O
's O
case O
. O
It O
's O
not O
enough O
to O
argue B-EVENT
Elian O
may O
suffer B-EVENT
privation B-EVENT
or O
oppression B-EVENT
in O
Fidel O
Castro O

Communist O

The O
INS O
routinely O
sends B-EVENT
prospective O
immigrants O
back O
to O
countries O
where O
poverty O
and O
tyranny O
are O
worse O
than O
in O
Cuba O
. O
What O
matters O
most O
is O
that O
Elian O
, O
after O
losing B-EVENT
his O
mother O
and O

in O
a O
disastrous O

sea O
voyage B-EVENT
to O
the O

, O
they O
ca O

give B-EVENT
him O
all O
the O

there O

that O

more O

The O
next O
order O
of O

for O
the O
Justice O

the O
INS O
is O
to O
resolve B-EVENT
Elian O

He O

been O
separated B-EVENT

too O

Besides O
, O
the O
longer O
his O

is O
put B-EVENT

the O
greater O
the O

by O

Elian O

did O

back B-EVENT

In O
a O

Manuel O

filed B-EVENT
a O
motion O

that O
he O
could O
help B-EVENT
reunite B-EVENT
the O

It O
was O
a O
move O
that O
many O
see B-EVENT
as O
courageous O

others O
fear O
may O
be O

" O
I O
have O
lost B-EVENT

told B-EVENT

His O

buzzed B-EVENT

A O
day O
after O

Long O
before O
Elian O
thrust B-EVENT
them O
into O
the O

Damien O
Fernandez O

" O

For O

Castro O
relaxed B-EVENT

The O
terms O
of O
the O

changed B-EVENT
dramatically O

however O
, O
when O
Castro O
announced B-EVENT
last B-TIMEX3
Wednesday I-TIMEX3
that O
the O
boy O

ready O

his O

. O
Over O
the B-TIMEX3
weekend I-TIMEX3
, O
lawyers O
for O
the O

raised B-EVENT
accusations O
that O
Juan O
Miguel O
Gonzalez O
had O
mistreated B-EVENT
his O
son O
in O
telephone O
conversations B-EVENT
, O
saying B-EVENT
he O
had O
told B-EVENT
the O
boy O
that O
his O

was O
alive O
and O
waiting B-EVENT
for O
him O
in O
Cuba O
. O
But O
by O
Monday B-TIMEX3
, O
federal O
officials O
hardened O
their O
negotiating B-EVENT
stance O
, O
insisting B-EVENT
the O
boy O
would O
be O
turned B-EVENT
over O
to O
his O
father O
once O
the O
Cuban O
group O
arrives B-EVENT
in O
the O
United O

. O
Moves O
to O
keep B-EVENT
Elian O
in O
this O
country O
through O
federal O
legislation O
appear B-EVENT
to O
be O
stymied B-EVENT
, O
as O
most O
lawmakers O
seem B-EVENT
to O
agree B-EVENT
the O
boy O
should O
go B-EVENT
back O
to O
Cuba O
. O
A O

ABC O

6 O

10 O

also O
believe B-EVENT
the O

should O
go B-EVENT
home O
with O
his O

But O
in O
Miami O
, O
Cuban O
exiles O
insist B-EVENT
the O
majority O
of O
Americans O
do O
n't O
understand B-EVENT
the O
dynamics O
of O
life O
in O
Cuba O

Just O
how O
far O
they O
are O
willing O

: O
Juan O
Miguel O

has O
made B-EVENT
the O
right O
decision B-EVENT
to O
travel B-EVENT
to O
the O
United O

on O
Thursday B-TIMEX3
to O
affirm B-EVENT
his O
desire O
to O
be O
reunited B-EVENT
with O
his O
son O
, O
Elian O
. O
His O
presence O
on O
American O
soil O
is O
necessary O
to O
dispel B-EVENT
doubts O
about O
his O
fitness O
as O
a O
father O
_ O
raised B-EVENT
maliciously O
by O
Elian O
's O
Miami O
relatives O
_ O
and O
to O
end B-EVENT
speculation B-EVENT
that O
he O
is O
indifferent O
about O
reclaiming B-EVENT
custody O
of O
his O
son O
. O
With O
Gonzalez O
all O
but O
out O
of O
sight O
in O
Cuba O
, O
the O
relatives O
have O
had O
a O
free O
hand O
to O
distort B-EVENT
the O
case O
with O
bogus O
legal O
arguments O
and O
unsubstantiated O
claims B-EVENT
that O
Elian O
is O
afraid O
to O
see B-EVENT
his O
father O
. O

The O
relatives O
are O
obviously O
fond O
of O
Elian O
, O
though O
their O
judgment O
has O
clearly O
been O
clouded B-EVENT
by O
their O
animosity O
toward O
Fidel O
Castro O
, O
the O
Cuban O
leader O
. O
Once O
Gonzalez O
comes B-EVENT
to O
the O
United O
States O
_ O
it O
would O
be O
preferable O
if O
he O
went B-EVENT
to O
Miami O
rather O
than O
to O
Washington O
_ O
only O
the O
most O
obdurate O
foes O
of O
Castro O
can O
argue B-EVENT
that O
Elian O
should O
not O
be O
reunited B-EVENT
with O
him O
. O
Gonzalez O
's O
arrival B-EVENT
should O
also O
help B-EVENT
clear B-EVENT
the O
way O
for O
the O
Justice O
Department O
to O
make B-EVENT
arrangements B-EVENT
to O
transfer B-EVENT
custody O
of O
the O
child O
. O
The O
Miami O
relatives O
have O
left B-EVENT
unclear O
whether O
they O
will O
willingly O
relinquish B-EVENT
custody O
of O
Elian O
, O
and O
have O
done O
their O
best O
to O
stir B-EVENT
passions O

against O
the O
Justice O
Department O
among O
Cuban O
- O
Americans O
in O
South O
Florida O
. O
In O
hopes O
of O
trumping B-EVENT
the O
law O
, O
they O
have O
unreasonably O
demanded B-EVENT
that O
a O
panel O
of O
child O
psychologists O
determine B-EVENT
Elian O
's O
fate O
. O
The O
best O
outcome B-EVENT
would O
be O
for O
the O
relatives O
to O
turn B-EVENT
Elian O
over O
to O
his O
father O
as O
soon O
as O
Gonzalez O
arrives B-EVENT
, O
and O
to O
do B-EVENT
so O
in O
a O
spirit O
of O
kinship O
that O
makes B-EVENT
the O
transition B-EVENT
as O
smooth O
as O
possible O
for O
Elian O
. O
Once O
that O
happens B-EVENT
, O
Gonzalez O
and O
Elian O
, O
though O
technically O
free O
to O
return B-EVENT
to O
Cuba O
, O
should O
remain O
here O
to O
await B-EVENT
an O
appellate O
court O
ruling B-EVENT
on O
the O
case O
, O
which O
is O
expected B-EVENT
next B-TIMEX3
month I-TIMEX3
. O
But O
if O
the O
relatives O
balk B-EVENT
, O

the O
Justice O
Department O
should O
quickly O
revoke B-EVENT
their O
custody O
of O
the O
child O
and O
obtain B-EVENT
a O
federal O
court O
order B-EVENT
instructing B-EVENT
them O
and O
their O
lawyers O
to O
turn B-EVENT
Elian O
over O
to O
his O
father O
. O
The O
relatives O
may O
be O
less O
defiant O
if O
they O
are O
held B-EVENT
in O
contempt O
of O
court O
. O
If O
a O
court O
edict B-EVENT
fails B-EVENT
to O
compel B-EVENT
compliance B-EVENT
, O
the O
Justice O
Department O
will O
have O
to O
consider B-EVENT
sterner O
measures O
, O
for O
the O
relatives O
will O
then O
be O
resisting B-EVENT
the O
rule O
of O
law O
as O
defined B-EVENT
by O
both O
the O
department O
and O
the O
courts O
. O
But O
Washington O
ought O
not O
to O
rush B-EVENT
to O
take B-EVENT
Elian O
forcibly O
from O
the O
relatives O
. O
That O
course O
would O
be O
psychologically O
wounding O
to O
the O
boy O
, O
and O
could O
lead B-EVENT
to O
a O
violent O
confrontation B-EVENT
with O
demonstrators O
who O

gather B-EVENT
daily B-TIMEX3
outside O
the O
relatives O
' O
home O
. O
The O
government O
yields B-EVENT
none O
of O
its O
legal O
or O
moral O
authority O
in O
the O
case O
if O
it O
gives B-EVENT
the O
relatives O
and O
their O
supporters O
time O
to O
reflect B-EVENT
and O
to O
look B-EVENT
for O
a O
gentler O
resolution B-EVENT
. O
As O
a O
matter O
of O
law O
, O
compassion O
and O
common O
sense O
, O
the O
government O
is O
entitled O
to O
reunite B-EVENT
Elian O
with O
his O
father O
, O
and O
it O
has O
the O
power O
to O
enforce B-EVENT
that O
right O
, O
despite O
the O
bluster O
of O
Miami O
's O
demagogic O
political O
leaders O
. O
But O
for O
now B-TIMEX3
, O
everyone O
involved O
should O
be O
searching B-EVENT
for O
an O
amicable O
ending B-EVENT
. O
Juan O
Gonzalez O
is O
doing B-EVENT
his O
part O
by O
making B-EVENT
the O
short O
journey B-EVENT
