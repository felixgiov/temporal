For O
his O

Fidel O

the O

People O

a O
reason O

This O
is O
clearly O
an O
opportunity O
for O
Cuba O
to O
look O
good O
internationally O
. O
The O
entire O
world O
will O
see B-EVENT
images O

They O
'll O
see B-EVENT
images O
of O
the O
Pope O

It O
will O
give B-EVENT
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
the O
view O
that O
Cuba O
is O
like O
any O
other O
nation O
, O
something O
the O
US O
has O
, O
of O
course O
, O
tried B-EVENT
to O
persuade B-EVENT
the O
world O
that O
it O
is O
not O
. O
For O
nearly B-TIMEX3
forty I-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
, O
the O
United O

has O
said B-EVENT
categorically O
it O
would O
not O
tolerate B-EVENT
totalitarian O
rule O
in O
its O
own O
backyard O
. O
It O
is O
the O
US O
economic O
and O
political O
embargo B-EVENT
which O
has O
kept B-EVENT
Cuba O
in O
a O
box O
. O
The O
main O
positive O
for O
Castro O
to O
invite B-EVENT
the O
Pope O
is O
international O
, O
to O
be O
able B-EVENT
to O
say B-EVENT
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
, O
this O
government O
is O
not O
as O
closed O
, O
as O
intolerant O
, O
uh O
as O
totalitarian O
as O
some O
make B-EVENT
it O
out O
to O
be O
. O
One O
of O
the O
scenarios O
widely O
advanced B-EVENT
before O
the O
visit B-EVENT
is O
that O
through O
the O
Pope O
, O
Cuba O
, O
still O
led B-EVENT
by O
Castro O
, O
can O
begin B-EVENT
a O
more O
productive O
relationship O
with O
the O
world O
. O
That O
will O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
bring B-EVENT
pressure O
on O
Washington O
to O
change B-EVENT
. O
Those O
observers O
looking B-EVENT
for O
a O
battle B-EVENT
between O
uncompromising O
representatives O
and O
very O
different O
ideologies O
will O
, O
in O
all O
likelihood O
, O
be O
disappointed B-EVENT
. O
Castro O
has O
said O
that O
you O
can O
be O
a O
Communist O
and O
still O
be O
a O
Christian O
. O
He O
says B-EVENT
he O
and O
the O
Pope O
both O
want B-EVENT
to O
end B-EVENT
the O
exploitation B-EVENT
of O
man O
by O
man O
. O
The O
question O
is O
who O
will O
Cubans O
believe B-EVENT
? O
The O
main O
negative O
is O
the O
risk O
that O
the O
Pope O
's O
visit B-EVENT
will O
persuade B-EVENT
a O
great O
many O
more O
Cubans O
to O
break B-EVENT
loose O
of O
the O
Cuban O
government O
. O
If O
so O
, O
then O
the O
Pope O
's O
visit B-EVENT
would O
really O
open B-EVENT
up O
a O
new O
chapter O
in O
the O
government O
's O
relations O
with O
its O
own O
society O
. O
For O
the O
Cuban O
government O
, O
that O
is O
the O
risk O

The O

The O
Saudi O

the O

Ann O

the O
Saudis O
were O
just O
providing B-EVENT

it O
was O
unfair B-EVENT

We O

further B-EVENT
the O

by O
violating B-EVENT
the O
human O

But O
opponents O
said B-EVENT
the O

might O
be O
a O
target O
for O
terrorist O
attacks B-EVENT
, O
complained B-EVENT
about O
its O

Mr. O

says B-EVENT
the O
growth B-EVENT
is O
surprising B-EVENT
since O

We O

the O

The O

certainly O

change B-EVENT
the O
way O
transplant O

. O
Under O
the O
new O
guidelines O

to O
the O
sickest O
people O
first O
, O
wherever O
they O

Currently O
, O

or O
UNOS O

objects O
to O
the O
new O

UNOS O
says B-EVENT
the O
regulations O
put B-EVENT
the O
federal O
government O
in O
charge O
of O
deciding B-EVENT
who O
gets B-EVENT
transplants O
and O
that O
many O
hospital O

would O
be O
forced B-EVENT

Secretary O

Donna O
Shalala O
says B-EVENT
patients O
who O
need B-EVENT
an O
organ O
transplant O
should O
not O
have O
to O
take B-EVENT
a O
chance O
that O
an O
organ O
will O
become B-EVENT
available O
in O
their O
local O
area O
, O
nor O
should O
patients O
have O
to O
travel B-EVENT
to O
transplant O
centers O
far O
from O
their O
homes O
to O
improve B-EVENT
their O
chances O
of O
getting B-EVENT
an O
organ O
. O
UNOS O
spokeswoman O
Donna O
Henry O
Wright O
says B-EVENT
the O
new O
policy O
would O
not O
necessarily O
be O
more O
fair B-EVENT
or O
effective B-EVENT
because O
allowances O
are O
already O
made B-EVENT
for O
the O
most O
needy O
patients O
. O
The O
sickest O
patients O
are O
already O
treated B-EVENT
first O
. O
There O
are O
not O
huge O
waiting O
uh O
disparit O
- O
waiting O
time O
disparities O
amongst O
the O
very O
uh O
sickest O
patients O
. O
It O
's O
between O
two B-TIMEX3
to O
six B-TIMEX3
days I-TIMEX3
for O
every O
one O
uh O
of O
the O
sickest O
patients O
across O
the O
country O
. O
um O
So O
it O
's O
a O
- O
it O
's O
a O
fallacy O
that O
they O
're O
doing B-EVENT
this O
because O
um O
the O
sickest O
patients O
are O
n't O
being O
served B-EVENT
. O

, O
said B-EVENT
the O
current O
system O
has O
evolved B-EVENT
over O
several B-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
and O
it O
works B-EVENT
well O
. O
You O
may O
, O
in O
a B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
or I-TIMEX3
two I-TIMEX3
, O
save B-EVENT
a O
few O
more O
lives O
if O
you O
do O
sickest O
first O
. O
But O
the O
number O
of O
patients O
waiting B-EVENT
then O
begins B-EVENT
to O
increase B-EVENT
, O
um O
and O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
um O
over O
the B-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
many O
more O
patients O
who O
are O
about O
to O
die O
of O
liver O
tra O
- O
uh O
without O
a O
liver O
transplant O
would O
accumulate B-EVENT
. O
If O
you O
do B-EVENT
the O
uh O
alternative O
extreme O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
save B-EVENT
as O
many O
lives O
in O
the B-TIMEX3
early I-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
, O
by O
a O
small O
fraction O
. O
Our O
system O
is B-EVENT
balanced O
, O
it O
's O
right O
in O
the O
middle O
. O
And O
, O
therefore O
, O
it O
works B-EVENT
very O
well O
. O
Nationwide O
, O
there O
are O
about O
ten O
thousand O
patients O
waiting B-EVENT
for O
liver O
transplants O
each B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
and O
only O
four O
thousand O
organs O
become B-EVENT
available O
for O
transplants B-EVENT
. O
Secretary O
Shalala O
says B-EVENT
UNOS O
five B-TIMEX3
months I-TIMEX3
ago I-TIMEX3
, O
or O
gave B-EVENT
them O
five B-TIMEX3
months I-TIMEX3
to O
develop B-EVENT
a O
new O
plan B-EVENT
to O

At O

Mr. O

suggested B-EVENT
Israel O
might O
be O
willing B-EVENT
to O
move B-EVENT
a O
little O
on O
issues O
holding B-EVENT
up O
peace O
, O
but O
he O
said B-EVENT
he O
expects B-EVENT
an O
equal O
effort B-EVENT
from O
the O
Palestinians O
. O
If O
Israel O
is O
asked B-EVENT
to O
uh O
stretch B-EVENT
itself O
on O
matters O
that O
are O
vital O
to O
its O

then O
we O
must O
see B-EVENT
an O
equal O
effort O
on O
the O

Mr. O

called B-EVENT
on O
Israel O
to O
continue B-EVENT

Iraq O

Saddam O
Hussein O
, O
his O
options O
for O
ending B-EVENT
the O
Persian O
Gulf O
crisis B-EVENT
growing O
increasingly O
unpleasant O
, O
assumed B-EVENT
the O
role B-EVENT
of O
embattled O
Arab O

in O
offering B-EVENT
his O
first O
rough O
proposal B-EVENT
for O
a O

end B-EVENT
to O
the O

. O
The O
Iraqi O
leader O
, O
in O
an O
" O
initiative B-EVENT
" O
designed B-EVENT
as O
much O
to O
rally B-EVENT
Arab O
public O
opinion B-EVENT
as O
to O
launch B-EVENT
meaningful O
negotiations B-EVENT
, O
announced B-EVENT
yesterday B-TIMEX3
that O
he O
will O
withdraw B-EVENT
his O
troops O
from O
Kuwait O
only O
if O
Israel O
withdraws B-EVENT
from O
the O
West O
Bank O
and O
Syria O
from O
Lebanon O
. O
He O
apparently O
hopes B-EVENT
to O
lure B-EVENT
support B-EVENT
from O
Arabs O
who O
have O
spurned B-EVENT
him O
so O
far O
by O
suggesting B-EVENT
that O
Iraq O
will O
use B-EVENT
its O
occupation B-EVENT
of O
Kuwait O
as O
a O
lever O
to O
solve B-EVENT
the O
Arab O
world O
's O
most O
frustrating O
problem B-EVENT
, O
the O
23 B-TIMEX3
- I-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
Israeli O
occupation B-EVENT
of O
land O
claimed B-EVENT
by O
Palestinians O
. O
Even O
as O
Saddam O
Hussein O
was O
searching B-EVENT
for O
a O
ploy B-EVENT
to O
ease B-EVENT
his O
isolation O
, O
though O
, O
the O
international O
pressure B-EVENT
against O
him O
clicked B-EVENT
up O
another O
notch O
. O
The O
White O
House O
yesterday B-TIMEX3
disclosed B-EVENT
that O
Kuwait O

ousted O

has O
formally O
asked B-EVENT
the O
U.S. O
to O
enforce B-EVENT
the O
total O

the O
United O

has O
imposed B-EVENT
on O

immediately O

, O
speaking B-EVENT
on O
ABC O

' O
" O
This O
Week O
, O
" O
said B-EVENT
the O
Kuwaiti O
request B-EVENT
gives B-EVENT
the O
U.S. O
and O
other O
countries O
" O
a O
legal O
basis O
for O
stopping B-EVENT
the O
export B-EVENT
of O
oil O
and O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
. O
" O
The O
U.S. O
maintains B-EVENT
that O
under O
the O
U.N. O
charter O
, O
the O
Kuwaiti O
request B-EVENT
triggers B-EVENT
steps O
for O
the O
collective O
enforcement B-EVENT
of O
international O
sanctions B-EVENT
. O
Mr. O
Baker O
declined B-EVENT
to O
use B-EVENT
the O
word O
blockade O
, O
but O
said B-EVENT
that O
" O
interdiction B-EVENT
" O
of O
Iraqi O
shipments B-EVENT
would O
begin B-EVENT
" O
almost O
instantly O
. O
" O
In O
a O
statement B-EVENT
, O
the O
White O
House O
said B-EVENT
it O
would O
do B-EVENT
" O
whatever O
is O
necessary O
" O
to O
ensure B-EVENT
compliance O
with O
the O
sanctions B-EVENT
. O
Other O
Bush O
administration O
officials O
said B-EVENT
that O
the O
international O
naval O
force O
in O
the O
area O
-- O
consisting O
of O
American O
, O
British O
, O
French O
, O
Canadian O
, O
Soviet O
, O
German O

Australian O
ships O
-- O
may O
be O
used B-EVENT
both O
to O
stop B-EVENT
oil O
exports O
from O
leaving B-EVENT
Iraq O
and O
Kuwait O
and O
to O
stop B-EVENT
shipments O
of O
food O
and O
other O
goods O
from O
going B-EVENT
in O
. O
President O
Bush O
implied B-EVENT
as O
much O
yesterday B-TIMEX3
when O
reporters O
asked B-EVENT
whether O
the O
interdiction B-EVENT
would O
apply B-EVENT
to O
food O
. O
The O
president O
responded B-EVENT
, O
" O
Everything O
, O
everything O
. O
" O
While O
shying B-EVENT
away O
from O
actually O
using B-EVENT
the O
word O
" O
blockade O
, O
" O
Mr. O
Bush O
acknowledged B-EVENT
that O
the O
U.S. O
and O
others O
were O
trying B-EVENT
to O
block B-EVENT
shipping B-EVENT
to O
Iraq O
. O
" O
No O
point O
getting O
into O
all O
these O
semantics O
, O
" O
he O
said B-EVENT
. O
" O
The O
main O
thing O
is O
to O
stop B-EVENT
the O
oil O
from O
coming B-EVENT
out O
of O
there O
. O
" O
The O
naval O
interdiction O
force O
is O
part O
of O
an O
overall O
American O
strategy O
that O
officials O
say O
is O
designed O
to O
leave O
the O
Iraqi O
leader O
with O
only O
the O
stark O
choice O
of O
backing O
out O
of O
Kuwait O
or O
launching O
new O
attacks O
to O
change O
his O
situation O
. O
Though O
they O
insist O
they O
are O
n't O
trying B-EVENT
to O
lure O
Saddam O
Hussein O
into O
an O
attack O
, O
officials O
hope O
that O
if O
he O
strikes O
again O
, O
the O
U.S. O
and O
its O
allies O
will O
have O
such O
an O
impressive O
force O
in O
place O
in O
Saudi O
Arabia O
that O
they O
will O
be O
able O
to O
crush O
him O
in O
retaliation O
. O
Iraq O
's O
first O
option O
, O
of O
course O
, O
may O
be O
simply O
to O
sit O
tight O
and O
hope O
it O
can O
endure O
a O
trade O
embargo O
longer O
than O
the O
West O
can O
live O
without O
Iraqi O
and O
Kuwaiti O
oil O
. O
Speaking O
on O
the O
ABC O
program O
, O
Abdul O
Amir O
al O
- O
Anbari O
, O
Iraq O
's O
ambassador O
to O
the O
U.N. O
, O
asserted O
that O
an O
embargo O
on O
Iraq O
could O
plunge O
the O
U.S. O
into O
a O
" O
depression O
" O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
into O
an O
economic O
" O
crisis O
. O
" O
Iraq O
clearly O
is O
trying O
to O
woo B-EVENT
back O
more O
Arab O
support B-EVENT
in O
case O
the O
conflict B-EVENT
drags B-EVENT
on O
, O
hoping B-EVENT
that O
its O
neighbors O
eventually O
will O
help B-EVENT
it O
survive B-EVENT
a O
prolonged O
war B-EVENT
of O
economic O
attrition O
with O
the O
West O
. O
So O
Saddam O
Hussein O
on O
Friday B-TIMEX3
tried B-EVENT
to O
scare B-EVENT
other O
Arab O
leaders O
into O
supporting B-EVENT
him O
by O
calling B-EVENT
on O
Arabs O
to O
rise B-EVENT
up O
in O
a O
holy O
war B-EVENT
against O
leaders O
who O
invited B-EVENT
American O
and O
other O
Western O
soldiers O
into O
Saudi O
Arabia O
to O
protect B-EVENT
the O
oil O
- O
rich O
kingdom O
. O
Then O
yesterday B-TIMEX3
, O
he O
tried B-EVENT
to O
entice B-EVENT
Arab O
leaders O
with O
his O
proposal B-EVENT
for O
a O
diplomatic O
solution O
linking B-EVENT
his O
occupation B-EVENT
of O
Kuwait O
with O
Israel O
's O
occupation B-EVENT
of O
the O
West O
Bank O
. O
The O
proposal B-EVENT
also O
called B-EVENT
for O
replacing B-EVENT
American O
and O
other O
Western O
troops O
in O
Saudi O
Arabia O
with O
Arab O
forces O
. O
The O
Bush O
administration O
immediately O
said B-EVENT
it O
" O
categorically O
" O
rejects B-EVENT
the O
proposals B-EVENT
. O
And O
President O
Bush O
yesterday B-TIMEX3
, O
asked B-EVENT
whether O
he O
was O
at O
least O
glad O
Iraq O
is O
discussing B-EVENT
negotiations B-EVENT
, O
replied B-EVENT
: O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
see B-EVENT
anything O
to O
be O
pleasing B-EVENT
in O
there O
at O
all O
. O
" O
American O
strategists O
are O
calculating O
, O
though O
, O
that O
the O
trade O
sanctions O
-- O
enforced O
by O
an O
effective O
though O
perhaps O
undeclared O
naval O
blockade O
-- O
will O
hold O
tightly O
enough O
to O
convince O
Iraq O
that O
it O
will O
lose O
in O
the O
long O
run O
by O
simply O
standing O
pat O
. O
At O
that O
point O
, O
rather O
than O
go B-EVENT
through O
the O
humiliation O
of O
backing B-EVENT
out O
of O
Kuwait O
, O
the O
Iraqis O
might O
well O
conclude B-EVENT
that O
they O
need B-EVENT
to O
lash B-EVENT
out O
in O
some O
way O
to O
shake B-EVENT
things O
up O
. O
In O
that O
event O
, O
Saddam O
Hussein O
appears B-EVENT
to O
have B-EVENT
three O
choices O
. O
The O
first O
would O
be O
to O
launch B-EVENT
the O
much O
- O
feared O
direct O
invasion B-EVENT
of O
Saudi O
Arabia O
, O
hoping B-EVENT
to O
seize B-EVENT
some O
Saudi O
oil O
fields O
and O
improve B-EVENT
his O
bargaining O
position O
. O
But O
that O
option O
is O
growing B-EVENT
less O
and O
less O
likely O
as O
thousands O
of O
American O
, O
British O
, O
Egyptian O
, O
Syrian O
and O
Moroccan O
forces O
assemble B-EVENT
in O
and O
around O
Saudi O
Arabia O
to O
protect B-EVENT
the O
kingdom O
. O
The O
Saudis O
even O
have O
in O
their O
possession O
48 O
Kuwaiti O
jet O
fighters O
, O
virtually O
the O
entire O
Kuwaiti O
air O
force O
, O
which O
managed B-EVENT
to O
escape B-EVENT
the O
Iraqi O
invasion B-EVENT
, O
Saudi O
officials O
said B-EVENT
. O
The O
Saudi O
" O
window O
of O
vulnerability O
... O
is O
closing B-EVENT
very O
fast O
, O
" O
Prince O
Bandar O
bin O
Sultan O
, O
the O
Saudi O
ambassador O
to O
Washington O
, O
said B-EVENT
over O
the B-TIMEX3
weekend I-TIMEX3
. O
The O
second O
possibility O
would O
be O
to O
start B-EVENT
a O
fight B-EVENT
with O
Israel O
, O
in O
hopes O
that O
all O
Arabs O
would O
have O
to O
move B-EVENT
behind O
Iraq O
in O
a O
fight B-EVENT
against O
their O
common O
Israeli O
enemy O
. O
In O
such O
an O
event O
, O
Saddam O
Hussein O
also O
might O
calculate B-EVENT
, O
the O
Saudis O
would O
be O
under O
pressure O
to O
kick B-EVENT
out O
U.S. O
troops O
because O
of O
America O
's O
close O
ties O
with O
Israel O
. O
Iraq O
could O
start B-EVENT
hostilities B-EVENT
with O
Israel O
either O
through O
a O
direct O
attack B-EVENT
or O
by O
attacking B-EVENT
Jordan O
. O
Israel O
has O
publicly O
declared B-EVENT
that O
it O
will O
respond B-EVENT
to O
an O
Iraqi O
attack B-EVENT
on O
Jordan O
because O
it O
wo O
n't O
allow B-EVENT
Iraq O
's O
dangerous O
army O
to O
take B-EVENT
control O
of O
Jordan O
's O
long O
border O
with O
Israel O
. O
Iraq O
's O
third O
attack O
option O
would O
be O
to O
start B-EVENT
an O
undeclared O
war B-EVENT
on O
the O
U.S. O
and O
other O
Western O
nations O
through O
terrorism O
. O
Two O
Middle O
East O
terrorists O
with O
records O
of O
successful O
attacks O
against O
Western O
targets O
, O
Abu O
Nidal O
and O
Abu O
Abbas O
, O
have O
ties O
to O
Baghdad O
. O
And O
even O
terrorist O
groups O
that O
opposed O
Iraq O
in O
its O
war O
with O
Iran O
show O
signs O
of O
swinging O
behind O
Saddam O
Hussein O
now B-TIMEX3
that O
he O
is O
in O
a O
confrontation O
with O
the O
U.S. O
And O
Iraq O
still O
has B-EVENT
thousands O
of O
Americans O
and O
other O
Westerners O
under O
its O
control O
in O
Iraq O
and O
Kuwait O
. O
They O
are O
n't O
being O
allowed B-EVENT
to O
leave B-EVENT
and O
could O
become B-EVENT
hostages O
. O
If O
Iraq O
chooses O
a O
simple O
war O
of O
nerves O
and O
economic O
attrition O
, O
the O
Bush O
administration O
knows O
a O
long O
stalemate O
could O
try O
the O
patience O
of O
the O
American O
public O
and O
the O
West O
in O
general O
, O
and O
could O
open O
the O
possibility O
that O
moderate O
Arabs O
-- O
even O
including O
Saudi O
Arabia O
-- O
might O
drop O
out O
of O
the O
effort O
against O
Iraq O
and O
accept O
some O
deal O
from O
Saddam O
Hussein O
. O
But O
U.S. O
officials O
have O
sized B-EVENT
up O
Saddam O
Hussein O
as O
a O
man O
who O
, O
despite O
some O
recklessness O
, O
will O
back B-EVENT
down O
if O
he O
must O
. O
" O
This O
is O
a O
guy O
who O
is O
impulsive O
, O
and O
therefore O
capable O
of O
big O
miscalculations O
, O
" O
says B-EVENT
one O
senior O
administration O
official O
involved O
in O
managing B-EVENT
the O
crisis B-EVENT
. O
The O
official O
adds B-EVENT
, O
though O
, O
that O
" O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
we O
think B-EVENT
he O
is O
someone O
who O
is O
capable B-EVENT
of O
rational O
judgments O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
power O
. O
And O
when O
he O
finds B-EVENT
something O
is O
unprofitable O
, O
then O
one O
can O
see B-EVENT
certain O
accommodations B-EVENT
. O
" O
Thus O
, O
administration O
aides O
will O
be O
trying B-EVENT
to O
calculate B-EVENT
whether O
Saddam O
Hussein O
's O
proposed O
diplomatic O
formula O
for O
getting B-EVENT
out O
of O
Kuwait O
represents B-EVENT
the O
first O
sign O
he O
is O
searching B-EVENT
for O
a O
way O
out O
or O
simply O
is O
a O
public O
relations O
stunt B-EVENT
. O
There O
are O
disagreements O
among O
experts O
about O
how O
much O
pressure O
will O
be O
needed O
to O
make O
Saddam O
Hussein O
decide O
he O
's O
up O
against O
the O
wall O
and O
whether O
simple O
economic O
pressure O
will O
ever O
be O
enough O
. O
The O
biggest O
worry O
is O
that O
if O
he O
decides O
he O
needs O
a O
way O
out O
of O
his O
predicament O
but O
does O
n't O
see B-EVENT
a O
face O
- O
saving O
method O
, O
he O
could O
lash O
out O
in O
dangerous O
and O
unpredictable O
ways O
. O
U.S. O
officials O
claim O
they O
already O
see O
signs O
Saddam O
Hussein O
is O
getting O
nervous O
. O
In O
the O
first O
days O
after O
President O
Bush O
announced B-EVENT
the O
dispatching B-EVENT
of O
U.S. O
troops O
, O
they O
note O
, O
the O
Iraqi O
leader O
made B-EVENT
several O
nationwide O
addresses B-EVENT
indirectly O
-- O
having O
them O
read B-EVENT
by O
a O
television O
announcer O
. O
" O
That O
shows B-EVENT
he O
's O
nervous O
about O
pinpointing B-EVENT
his O
location O
, O
either O
because O
he O
's O
afraid O
we O
'll O
find B-EVENT
him O
, O
or O
that O
internal O
enemies O
will O
, O
" O
says B-EVENT
one O
U.S. O
official O
. O
The O
unpredictability O
of O
Iraq O
's O
leader O
is O
a O
principal O
reason O
the O
U.S. O
is O
going O
to O
such O
great O
lengths O
to O
build O
a O
mammoth O
force O
in O
and O
around O
Saudi O
Arabia O
. O
Pentagon O
officials O
say B-EVENT
the O
goal O
is O
to O
put B-EVENT
40,000 O
troops O
in O
the O
region O
by O
the B-TIMEX3
end I-TIMEX3
of I-TIMEX3
the I-TIMEX3
month I-TIMEX3
. O
But O
the O
administration O
is O
n't O
putting B-EVENT
any O
upper O
limit O
on O
how O
high O
the O
force O
could O
go B-EVENT
after O
that O
, O
calculating B-EVENT
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
mistake B-EVENT
to O
underestimate B-EVENT
and O
an O
advantage O
to O
keep B-EVENT
Saddam O
Hussein O
guessing B-EVENT
. O
U.S. O
commanders O
in O
charge O
of O
planning B-EVENT
for O
Middle O
East O
crises B-EVENT
have O
indicated B-EVENT
in O
the B-TIMEX3
past I-TIMEX3
that O
they O
were O
capable B-EVENT
of O
deploying B-EVENT
as O
many O
as O
300,000 O
troops O
. O
And O
the O
U.S. O
is O
taking B-EVENT
similar O
steps O
to O
ensure B-EVENT
that O
its O
naval O
force O
is O
adequate B-EVENT
to O
carry B-EVENT
out O
a O
blockade B-EVENT
of O
Iraq O
and O
support B-EVENT
a O
war B-EVENT
if O
necessary O
. O
Over O
the B-TIMEX3
weekend I-TIMEX3
, O
Pentagon O
officials O
confirmed B-EVENT
reports O
that O
a O
fourth O
U.S. O
aircraft O
carrier O
-- O
the O
John O
F. O
Kennedy O
-- O
and O
its O
powerful O
group O
of O
support O
ships O
could O
head B-EVENT
for O
the O
Middle O
East O
within O
a B-TIMEX3
few I-TIMEX3
days I-TIMEX3
. O
Three O
other O
carriers O
and O
their O
escort O
vessels O
already O
are O
stationed B-EVENT
within O
striking O
distance O
of O
Iraq O
or O
are O
steaming B-EVENT
toward O
the O
area O
. O
But O
unless O
the O
military O
situation O
changes B-EVENT
drastically O
, O
military O
officials O
say B-EVENT
, O
the O
most O
likely O
plan O
will O
be O
for O
the O
Kennedy O
to O
eventually O
replace B-EVENT
the O
carrier O
Dwight O
D. O
Eisenhower O
, O
which O
has O
been O
on O

since O
March B-TIMEX3

Iraq O
seemingly O
bent O

it O

" O
Despite O
the O

the O

it O

, O
American O

over O
the B-TIMEX3

Lt. O

Perhaps O
more O

it O

that O

the O

the O
mere O
fact O

offered B-EVENT

fully O
, O
instead O
of O
the B-TIMEX3
four I-TIMEX3

the O

the O

unacceptable B-EVENT

Finally O
, O
when O

, O
Mr. O

let B-EVENT

Saturday B-TIMEX3
night I-TIMEX3

The O

The O

much O

It O
expects B-EVENT

surrender B-EVENT

If O
the O
allies O
succeed B-EVENT
, O
Saddam O
Hussein O
will O
have O
plunged B-EVENT
his O
country O
first O
into O
a O
fruitless O
eight B-TIMEX3

year I-TIMEX3
war B-EVENT
against O
Iran O
and O
then O
into O
a O
humiliating O
war B-EVENT
against O
the O
U.S. O

the O
allies O
to O
defend B-EVENT
his O
conquest B-EVENT

the O

hopes B-EVENT

economic O

in O

The O
American O
hope O
is O
that O
someone O
from O

Iraq O
, O
perhaps O
from O
the O
army O

professional O

, O
will O
step O

aside O
so O
that O
the O

can O
begin O

. O
Outside O
analysts O
think B-EVENT
Saddam O

position O
is O
indeed O
precarious O

" O
I O
think O
frankly O
Saddam O

finished B-EVENT

" O

Despite O
the O
lack O
of O
any O
obvious O

the O
Iraqi O
leader O

internal O
power O
base O
appeared B-EVENT

narrowing B-EVENT
even O
before O
the O
war B-EVENT

Some O
analysts O

appeared B-EVENT
to O
be O
relying B-EVENT

a O
smaller O
and O
smaller O
circle O
of O
close O
advisers O

relatives O
. O
If O
that O
's O
true O
, O
the O
narrowing O
of O
his O
support O
would O
make B-EVENT
it O
easier O
for O
someone O
to O
push B-EVENT
him O
aside O
from O
within O
. O
Yet O
, O
paradoxically O
, O
the O
perception O
that O
the O
U.S. O
wants B-EVENT
to O
destroy B-EVENT
Iraq O
may O
increase B-EVENT
Saddam O
Hussein O

support O
within O

the O
U.S. O
now O

. O
Still O
, O
Unisys O
said B-EVENT
its O
European O
business O
was O
weak B-EVENT
during O
the B-TIMEX3
quarter I-TIMEX3
, O
a O
worrisome O
sign O
given O
that O
the O
company O
has O
relied B-EVENT
on O
solid O
results O
overseas O
to O
overcome B-EVENT
weakness O
in O
the O
U.S. O
over O
the B-TIMEX3
past I-TIMEX3
several I-TIMEX3
quarters I-TIMEX3
. O
The O
company O
also O
reported B-EVENT
slower O
growth B-EVENT
in O
another O
important O
business O
: O
systems O
that O
use O
the O
Unix O
operating O
system O
. O
That O
would O
be O
a O
huge O
problem B-EVENT
if O
it O
were O
to O
continue B-EVENT
, O
because O
Unisys O
is O
betting B-EVENT
its O
business O
on O
the O
assumption O
that O
customers O
want B-EVENT
to O
move B-EVENT
away O
from O
using O
operating O
systems O
that O
run O
on O
only O
one O
manufacturer O
's O
equipment O
and O
toward O
systems O
-- O
mainly O
Unix O
-- O
that O
work O
on O
almost O
anyone O
's O
machines O
. O
In O
addition O
, O
Unisys O
must O
deal B-EVENT
with O
its O
increasingly O
oppressive O
debt O
load O
. O
Debt O
has O
risen B-EVENT
to O
around O
$ O
4 O
billion O
, O
or O
about O
50 O
% O
of O
total O

. O
That O
means O
Unisys O
must O
pay B-EVENT
about O
$ O
100 O
million O
in O
interest O
every B-TIMEX3
quarter I-TIMEX3
, O
on O

Jim O
Unruh O
, O
Unisys O
's O
president O
, O
said B-EVENT
he O
is O
approaching B-EVENT
next O

with O
caution O
. O
He O
said B-EVENT
the O
strength O
of O
the O
world O

wide O
economy O
is O
suspect B-EVENT
, O
and O
does O
n't O
see O
much O
revenue O
growth O
in O
the O

. O
He O
also O
said B-EVENT
that O
the O
price O
wars O
flaring B-EVENT
up O
in O
parts O
of O
the O
computer O
industry O
will O
continue B-EVENT
through O
next B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
. O
He O
said B-EVENT
the O
move B-EVENT
toward O
standard O
operating O
systems O
means O
customers O
are O
n't O
locked B-EVENT
into O
buying O
from O
their O
traditional O
computer O
supplier O
and O
can O
force O
prices O
down O
. O
That O
, O
he O
said B-EVENT
, O
is O
why O
Unisys O
is O
overhauling B-EVENT
its O
whole O
business O
: O
It O
needs B-EVENT
to O
prepare B-EVENT
for O
a O
world O
in O
which O
profit O
margins O
will O
be O
lower B-EVENT
than O
computer O
companies O
have O
been O
used B-EVENT
to O
. O
" O
We O

approached B-EVENT
this O
not O
as O
a O

Statistics O

, O
most O
of O
the O

by O
all O

If O

the O

In O
a O

Mr. O

prohibited B-EVENT

At O
the O

time O
, O
he O
is O
expected B-EVENT
to O
seek B-EVENT
legal O
and O
regulatory O
means O
of O
blocking B-EVENT
or O
delaying B-EVENT
Paribas O
's O
bid B-EVENT
. O
For O
the O
moment O
, O
the O
sources O
said B-EVENT
, O
he O
has O
decided B-EVENT
against O
seeking B-EVENT
a O
white O

or O
organizing B-EVENT
a O

) O
, O
up O
from O

last B-TIMEX3

That O
is O
due O
mostly O
to O
payments B-EVENT
from O

for O
most O

the O
50 O
% O

it O
has O
agreed B-EVENT
to O
acquire B-EVENT
in O
Navigation O
Mixte O

. O
Mr. O
Fournier O
said B-EVENT
the O
exceptional O
gain O
would O
mean B-EVENT
nearly O
twice O
as O
high O
a O

this B-TIMEX3
year I-TIMEX3
as O
last B-TIMEX3
. O
If O

avoid B-EVENT
tendering B-EVENT

, O
he O
added B-EVENT
, O
they O
can O
expect B-EVENT
strong O

again O
next B-TIMEX3

Analysts O
noted B-EVENT
that O
over O
the B-TIMEX3
past I-TIMEX3
20 I-TIMEX3
years I-TIMEX3
, O
Mr. O
Fournier O
has O
built B-EVENT
his O
company O
through O
astute O
stock O

market O
activity O
and O
has O
warded B-EVENT
off O
at O

three O
takeover O
attempts B-EVENT
. O
This O
time O
, O
however O
, O
some O

think B-EVENT
he O
could O
face B-EVENT
a O
real O
battle B-EVENT

" O
Without O

Mr. O
de O
Cholet O
said B-EVENT
Mr. O
Fournier O
's O
biggest O
hope O
was O
to O
somehow O
persuade B-EVENT
regulatory O
authorities O
to O
block B-EVENT
the O
bid B-EVENT
. O
Paribas O
still O
needs O
the O
go O
- O
ahead O
from O
the O
Commission O
des O
Operations O
de O
Bourse O
, O
a O
government O
regulatory O
agency O
, O
but O
analysts O
said B-EVENT
that O
is O
considered O
likely O
. O
Mr. O
Fournier O
also O
noted B-EVENT
that O
Navigation O
Mixte O
joined B-EVENT
Paribas O
's O
core O
of O
shareholders O
when O
Paribas O
was O
denationalized B-EVENT
in O
1987 B-TIMEX3
, O
and O
said B-EVENT
it O
now B-TIMEX3
holds B-EVENT
just O
under O
5 O
% O
of O
Paribas O
's O
shares O
. O
Once O
he O
realized B-EVENT
that O
Paribas O
's O
intentions O
were O
n't O
friendly O
, O
he O
said B-EVENT
, O
but O
before O
the O
bid B-EVENT
was O
launched B-EVENT
, O
he O
sought B-EVENT
approval B-EVENT
to O
boost B-EVENT
his O
Paribas O
stake O
above O
10 O
% O
. O
The O
petition O
is O
still O
pending B-EVENT
, O
but O
Mr. O
Fournier O
downplayed B-EVENT
the O
likelihood O
of O
his O
organizing B-EVENT
a O
takeover O
bid B-EVENT
of O
his O
own O
for O
the O
much O
- O
larger O
Paribas O
. O
One O
big O
question O
now O
is O
the O
likely O
role O
of O
Mr. O
Fournier O

allies O
. O
Mr. O
Fournier O
said B-EVENT
the O

all O

him O
, O
but O
some O

said B-EVENT
they O
are O
n't O
so O
sure O
. O
Allianz O
, O
for O

, O

said B-EVENT

that O
